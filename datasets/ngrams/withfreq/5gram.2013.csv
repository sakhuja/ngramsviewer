I couldn't stir.  But before`1
I couldn't tell.  Towards`1

I couldn't think of anything`1
I couldn't think of it.`1
I couldn't try to quit`1
I couldn't, only to swear`1
I couldn't--bank too bluff.  I`1
I couldn't; I couldn't budge`1
I counted 'm myself." `1
I covered up their faces,`1
I crawled into a stateroom`1
I creeps to de do'`1
I crep' up there and`1
I crept along down the`1
I crept into a lumber-pile`1
I crept out with my`1

I dasn't scratch.  Then it`1
I dasn't try it.  Every`1
I dasn't, because the nigger`1
I declare it's too bad,`1
I declare to goodness I`1
I deserve; for who fetched`1
I did clip it along!`1
I did dream it, Huck;`1
I did honest.  I come`1
I did it myself.  It's`1
I did wish Aunt Sally`1
I did wish I had`1
I did wish the fool`1

I did.  She says:  "Take`1
I did.  There was a`1

I didn' hear sumf'n. Well,`1
I didn' k'yer no' mo'`1
I didn't _do_ it, anyway.`1
I didn't answer up prompt.`1
I didn't b'lieve I see`1
I didn't believe anybody was`1
I didn't believe that, because`1
I didn't breathe.  I was`1
I didn't care no more`1
I didn't care nothing for`1
I didn't care what was`1
I didn't do it pretty`1
I didn't do it straight`1
I didn't draw a breath`1
I didn't drink whisky; but`1
I didn't drop that. `1
I didn't even know; a`1
I didn't feel a bit`1
I didn't get any answer;`1
I didn't get pretty fur`1
I didn't go much on`1
I didn't go.  No high`1
I didn't have no reasoning`1
I didn't have none, so`1
I didn't have to be`1

I didn't hope so.  They`1

I didn't know.  Now this`1
I didn't know; I hadn't`1

I didn't like it much.`1
I didn't look at him`1
I didn't look up--seemed to`1
I didn't lose it all.`1
I didn't lose no time.`1
I didn't lose no time;`1
I didn't mean no harm.`1
I didn't mind, because I`1
I didn't need it to`1
I didn't notice how long`1
I didn't put it in,`1
I didn't raise some money`1
I didn't read the poetry.`1
I didn't rightly know what`1
I didn't run Jim off`1
I didn't say no more;`1
I didn't say nothing against`1
I didn't say nothing; then`1
I didn't see how I'd`1

I didn't!' interrupted Alice. `1
I didn't, and you know`1
I didn't,' said Alice: 'I`1
I didn't.  There was`1
I didn't.  As I sprung`1
I didn't.  There, now!" `1
I didn't.  What tow-head?  I`1

I didn't."  Then he`1
I didn't; so I told`1
I disremember her name--and they`1
I disremember now, and my`1

I do so like that`1
I do try all I`1
I do wonder what CAN`1

I don't think,' Alice went`1
I don't turn up it`1
I don't turn up wait`1
I don't understand. Where did`1
I don't want to go`1
I don't want to stay`1
I don't want to talk`1
I don't wish to go`1
I don't, but ma she`1
I don't.  I _had_ it,`1
I done before I was`1
I done it, and I`1
I done it, and he`1

I done some thinking.  I`1
I done the best I`1
I done the same with`1

I doubled back through the`1

I dream about them. `1
I dropped on my hands`1
I dropped the canoe down`1

_I'd_ wait, if it was`1

_I'll_ go. I've knowed him`1
_I_ don't believe there's an`1

_Moby Dick_ (1851), one of`1
_No_.  And ther' ain't no`1

_You_ don't like trouble and`1

_again_!  I see I`1
_again_, say it _again_! `1
_again_, say it _again_, say`1

_agin_; en it's come true;`1
_ain't!_  You never said no`1
_ain't_ but nine!" she says.`1
_ain't_ him, are you?" `1
_ain't_ it!  _yes_, sir, I`1
_ain't_ it?--and very convenient, too,`1
_ain't_ no witches.  I jis'`1
_all_ of 'em in a`1
_all_ of 'em preach the`1
_all_ that happened--it would make`1
_all_ the difficulties.  Well, we`1
_all_ the places.  The hogs`1
_all_ to come--everybody; for he`1
_all_!"  The king says,`1
_all_.  It's the gift of`1
_all_."  "Well, maybe you're`1
_all_?"  The duke says`1
_always_ is when it's done`1
_always_ make their pens out`1
_amounted_ to something being a`1
_and_ night, as I was`1
_and_ small profits!  It's a`1
_another_ lunatic.  I never heard`1
_another_ one that I'm letting`2
_anybody_ sqush to get fetched`1
_anybody_.  In my opinion, there's`1
_anyway_."  "That ain't got`1
_anyway_? 'n' who dug that-air`1
_are_ right."  "But I`1
_as_ brave, and no braver.`1
_ask_ you!  Well, I never`1

_before_ you go to Mr.`1

_begged_ him not to hurt`1

_believe_ that rubbage.  Cuss you,`1
_beneath_ pitifulness.  Now the thing`1
_besides_.  G'long to bed, and`1

_candles_ gone--that's what.  The rats`1
_care_, and warn't a-going to`1
_case-knife_."  I didn't know`1
_cents_ back, I'd call it`1
_chaw_, and you take the`1
_circumstances_!"  So he laughed`1
_comes_ out; and Jim don't,`1
_could_ he a-wanted of it,`1
_could_ he ever want of--"`1
_could_ help a body set`1
_could_ think of so many`1
_could_ you!"  Well, then,`1
_couldn't_ answer them straight, I`1
_couldn't_ breathe and hear such`1
_couldn't_ come and me miss`1
_couldn't_ hold in, and his`1
_couldn't_ miss him along the`1

_dey_ ain't no use to`1
_dey_ will, I reck'n, Mars`1

_did_ die.  Mortification set in,`1
_did_ hide that money there,`1
_did_ live yesterday evening." `1
_did_ pay you back some`1
_did_ say.  I reckon he`1
_did_ see on his breast`1
_did_ seem so good to`1
_did_ set him free--me and`1
_did_ start to tell him;`1
_did_ they git that grindstone`1
_did_ you get these amaz'n`1
_did_ you say, then?" `1
_did_!  Dey warn't gwyne to`1
_did_, I didn't _do_ it,`1
_did_.  And anybody would. Because,`1
_did_; and said that after`1
_didn't_ nuther."  "You did!"`1
_didn't_ steal that; and flour,`1
_didn't_.  We never seen any`1

_dis_ time.  But it's awluz`1

_do_ need skinning, there ain't`1
_do_ shet up!--s'pose the rats`1

_do_ with it?"  "_Do_`1
_do_ you get biscuits to`1

_don't_ break up and wash`1
_don't_ do nothing with it?`1
_don't_ git mad; didn't you`1
_don't_ it?"  The duke`1
_don't_ take on so; we`1
_don't_ you?  It's the worst`1
_don't_ you?"  "Maybe I`1
_done_ ef de snake bite`1
_done_ it.  And we done`1
_done_ it."  "I wisht`1
_down_ de biler-factry when he`1

_dozen_ says you!--_forty_ couldn't a`1

_ever_ going to see each`1
_ever_ hear of a prisoner`1
_every_ year, and so he`1
_everything_ on the raft. `1
_everything_ they had.  "Why,`1
_everything_--tell me all about 'm`1
_everything_.  They're so confiding and`1
_everything_.  Well, whilst they was`1
_families_ of boys that told`1

_first_. Who nailed him?" `1
_flash_ comes the light in`1
_for_?  Jist for noth'n. Jist`1
_for_?"  "Why, they're for`1
_get_ your nigger, that's all--so`1
_git_ that grindstone _in_ there,`1
_give it to the girls_."`1
_give_ them notice there won't`1
_gnaw_ him out, are we?"`1
_go_ on!  What did they`1
_go_ to hell"--and tore it`1
_gone_."  When he heard`1
_good_ look at you; and,`1
_got_ to be a slave,`1
_got_ to be done. But`1
_got_ to do his inscription`1
_got_ to do it with`1
_got_ to do it--I can't`1
_got_ to do it.  Don't`1

_half_ a man--like Buck Harkness,`1
_half_ the fun it was.`1
_handle_ the witch-things."  "_Hannel`1

_he_ begins to cry. `1

_he_ was dead, too, and`1
_he_ was satisfied; said he`1
_he_ was up to; but`1
_he_--"  I stopped.  I`1

_him_ when you got loose?`1
_him_, hain't we?  Of course.`1
_him_--and done it just as`1

_is_ good.  So somebody's got`1

_is_ the child talking about!`1
_is_ the lonesomest sound in`1

_is_ the matter with your`1

_is_ the name of that`1
_is_ their turn, and I'd`1
_is_ you a-talkin' 'bout?  I`1
_is_ your nigger--some idiots don't`1
_is_, though--straight as a string.`1
_it's_ all right, I've got`1
_itself_ off, s'I--somebody _sawed_ it,`1
_jeesum_, to plant, cover up;`1
_just_ as I expected.  So`1
_k'chunk_!--it had took all that`1
_ketching_?  Why, how you talk.`1
_kind_, and not be saying`1
_kind_."  Next Sunday we`1
_know_ it!" says I. `1
_know_ it's so--something tells me`1
_know_?  Don't answer me that`1
_knowed_ something was up.  And`1
_laid_ them; well, that looked`1
_lan_'! ain' dat Misto Tom?"`1
_last_, too.  You don't reckon`1
_leave_, dat's _shore_."  "Well,`1
_leave_--and take your half-a-man with`1
_left_ it laid out, then--it`1
_let on_ it's case-knives." `1
_let on_ that a lantern's`1
_let on_, to ourselves, that`1
_let_ me shove his head`1
_let_ you walk--it wouldn't be`1
_like_ an Englishman--not the king's`1
_like_ to!  And I orter,`1
_like_ to, and, blame it,`1
_like_," he says.  "It's real`1
_like_.  That'll answer.  Why couldn't`1
_listen_ at the man!  I`1
_live_!--why, I was that scared`1
_look_ at it, s'I--what _could_`1
_lovely_!--how _could_ you!"  Well,`1
_make_ no track.  "I`1
_make_ so many.  Jim said`1
_make_ you mine!'  "En`1
_man's_ safe in the hands`1
_man_ along.  Now _leave_--and take`1
_man_ at the head of`1
_man_ goes in the night,`1
_man_!  Because you're brave enough`1
_man_?  Why, a _man's_ safe`1
_me_ again.  He give me`1
_me_ any more that a`1
_me_ for?"  I says:`1
_me_ no more deffersits, long`1
_me_ to put in.  "Why,`1
_me_ to spell it next,`1
_me_ to stay--I couldn't do`1
_me_!  It would get all`1

_me_--or maybe Jim.  I was`1
_me_--signs is _signs_, mine I`1
_me_.  I couldn't get that`1
_me_.  I'm for putting him`1
_me_; and wherever I run`1
_me_?" he says.  "Well,"`1
_mean_," says I to myself;`1
_mighty_ good!--and mighty ingenious--under the`1
_mighty_ likely!" and shook me`1
_more_ generous by 'em if`1
_mornin_'--in a canoe?"  "I`1
_mumps_ for?"  "Why, because`1
_mumps_?"  "That's what Miss`1
_murrey_ in the fess, with`1
_must_ a been done; it`1
_must_ a come; and you've`1
_must_ go home--he must go`1
_my_ custom every time. `1
_my_ hands of the matter.`1
_my_ mind.  Well, then, what`1
_my_ nigger, and that was`1
_my_ sake."  Laws knows`1
_needed_. Well, I says, I`1
_never_ got to glory.  It`1
_never_ see the beat of`1
_nigger-stealer!_  "Oh, shucks!"  I`1
_nigger_, would I?--the only nigger`1
_niggers_ stole it!"  That`1
_niggers_ yet--they're in the worst`1
_no_ necessity for it.  And`1
_nobody_ don't know but me.`1
_nobody_ kin git up a`1

_now_, in the daytime; but`1
_now_."  So, drat him,`1
_now_; and don't you lose`1
_off_ of me."  "Well,`1
_off_, because--"  "Because you`1
_on_ to give up sin,`1
_on_.  Just _listen_ at the`1
_one's_ enough to be lost`1
_one_ of 'em."  "Well,`1
_only_ fren' ole Jim's got`1
_only_ one he's got now;`1
_or_ in the dexter base,`1
_orgo_, outside, open, abroad; and`1
_other_ way, that ever I`1
_ought_ to be a watchman.`1
_our_ nigger; yes, we did`1
_our_ show; but there warn't`1
_ourn_ but a shekel or`1
_ourn_--your Uncle Harvey's."  "His'n?`1
_out_ at once but just`1
_out_ of it.  Right then`1
_own up!_"  I was`1
_part_ of a man--Buck Harkness,`1
_particular_, that her uncle Hornback--"`1
_pay_ for it?  Do you`1
_please_!  There's one way yet--let's`1
_plenty_ help, too, s'I; ther's`1
_plug_."  All the streets`1
_plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk_, and says to`1
_pray_ for you, too!"--and she`1

_prisoner_ care whose--"  He`1

_put_ it dar?  Didn' he`1
_read_ his plates."  "That`1
_real_ pint is down furder--it's`1
_reckon_ he wanted with it?"`1
_reckon_ you won't!"  "No'm,`1
_reckon_!  It started thirty year`1
_reckon_!  There's two hunderd dollars`1
_rest_ of the town!  Then`1
_right_ to shut him up!`1
_right_ way--and it's the regular`1
_right_, and there ain't going`1
_rights_--that's what for.  But I`1
_rob_--sech poor sweet lambs as`1
_sable_, with his bundle over`1
_safer_ than a lie.  I`1
_said_ so; and she set`1
_said_--that ain't the thing.  The`1
_sawed_ it, s'I; that's my`1

_say_ I would do the`1
_say_ it?"  "Why, he`1
_say_ you done it, or--"`1
_say_, Aunt Sally, and if`1
_say_, Tom Sawyer, but how`1
_second_--we'll have them tarred and`1
_see_ him.  That _would_ be`1
_see_ that _they'd_ go and`1
_seen_ that the old gentleman`1
_sees_ us do it or`1
_sell_ all your property to`1
_sense_ in that," I says.`1
_set_ down, Sister Ridgeway.  Why,`1
_she_ waltzed in; and if`1
_sheet_ gone!  Well, for the`1
_sheet_?  _where's_ it gone, Lize?"`1
_ship clerk?_--so as to get`1
_shore_."  "Well, then, let`1
_signs_, mine I tell you;`1
_single_ word--if you _please_!  There's`1
_smell_ so like de nation,`1
_smelt_ late. You know what`1
_some_ light to see how`1

_something_ before we get through."`1
_sorry_ they was going out`1

_spare_ it.  I don't k'yer`1

_started_ right when he's little`1
_style_.  Don't you know nothing?"`1
_such_ a screechy laugh, and`1
_sure_.  So Jim he said`1
_take_ the things, I'll count`1
_talk_ like a man?  You`1
_talking_!"  I says; "your head`1
_tell_ me that was what`1
_tell_ you dey warn't no`1

_that 'll_ convince anybody the`1

_that's_ all right.  Miss Hooker`1
_that's_ certain."  "Why, what`1
_that_ ain't all.  There was`1
_that_ ain't the ticket, Miss`1
_that_ give him to be`1
_that_ got to do with`1
_that_ govment!  That ain't all,`1
_that_ no more.  And then`1
_that_ old ram, anyway.  All`1
_that_ speculation, you bet you.`1
_that_ to me if you`1
_that_, Huck Finn."  "Well,`1
_that_--you hear?"  Then he says`1
_the guns_; that's what I`1
_the_ change on top of`1
_the_ whole thing.  There ain't`1
_their_ turn now.  Well, it`1
_them_ again; and then says:`1
_them_ along, too!"  "We'll`1
_them_ feel ashamed."  "Why,`1
_them_.  He says:  "I`1
_them_; they're young and spry,`1
_them_?"  And somebody trotting`1
_then_ if I don't turn`1
_then_ what did you all`1
_then_! Indeed he wouldn't.  Said`1
_then_, would you?"  "No,`1
_there_, for gracious sakes?" `1
_these_ mumps.  These mumps is`1
_these_ things stand for?" `1
_these_ two ain't frauds, I`1
_these_ two handwritings, and anybody`1
_they'd_ be in this house`1
_they'd_ go and tell?  Ther'`1
_they_ ain't got noth'n' to`1
_they_ bowed the least bit`1
_they_ didn't know but what`1
_they_ died.  I can't; and`1
_they_ don't care a cent`1
_they_ get them?"  "Why,`1
_they_ never all slept at`1
_they_ turn. The duke he`1
_they_?"  "Why, everybody.  They`1
_think_ I do--he--well, I'll jest`1
_think_ of hurting a person`1
_think_ so if you'd a`1
_thinking_ about!" she says, and`1
_this_ ain't bully nor noth'n!`1
_this_ fortress was solid rock."`1
_this_ is a girl that`1
_this_ is a go!" says`1
_this_ old gentleman's hand writing,`1

_thought_ I heard and seen`1

a dollar for you.  Now`1
a dollar would git fo'`1

a dot.  It said he`1
a double house, and the`1
a double-barrel gun in his`1

a dough roof, and shut`1
a dove, and she was`1
a doze; but, on being`1
a dozen houses there, and`1
a dozen logs together; so`1
a dozen long gasps, his`1
a dozen made a jump`1
a dozen people got out`1
a dozen times, but I`1
a dozen.  One of these`1

a dreadful hurry--one of them's`1

a dreadfully ugly child: but`1
a dream does tire a`1

a duke's different.  But not`1

a failure. Alice heard it`1
a failure; for pretty soon`1
a fair fit.  I put`1

a steamboat without any lights.`1
a steamboat's wheel away down,`1

a steamboat.  About the`1

a step out'n dis place`1

a stick and broke it,`1
a stick over his shoulder,`1
a stick, and Jim grabbed`1
a stiff current, and the`1

a while, finding that nothing`1

a while.  They might suspicion`1
a while.  They turned around`1

a-snuffling:  "Why, duke, it`1

a-trembling, because I'd got to`1

a-trusting you all the time,`1
a-trying to steal out of`1
a-visiting there at Booth's Landing,`1
a-visiting up there to the`1

a-watching all the time, mind`1

a-weaving around the ring so`1
a-whimpering, and says:  "I`1
a-whirling around sudden, and saying`1

able! I shall be a`1
aboard I lit out for`1
aboard I sung out: `1
aboard and get out of`1
aboard of her and slink`1
aboard of her, but just`1
aboard of it again.  We`1
aboard the king went for`1
aboard the raft, feeling bad`1
aboard the wreck.  Well, about`1
aboard to answer questions but`1
aboard when she come along,`1
aboard, and Jim he grabbed`1
aboard, and he was so`1
aboard, and she was from`1
aboard, so I lost my`1
aboard, wide apart, and an`1
aboard," says the king.  "Hold`1
aboard--clumb in at an upstairs`1
aboard.  Den I was gwyne`1
aboard.  He says:  "I`1
aboard?  Now _you_ know he`1
about 'm all every one`1
about Cairo, Jim said. I`1
about Cairo, and wondered whether`1
about Donations to the Project`1
about Edmund Kean the Elder,`1
about England, and blest if`1
about General Washington and the`1
about George's--which was a carpenter;`1
about Harvey's--which was a dissentering`1
about Hicksville and everybody in`1
about I was sound asleep,`1
about Jim, and just described`1
about Louis Sixteenth that got`1
about Moses and the Bulrushers,`1
about Moses, which was no`1
about Peter's business--which was a`1
about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how`1
about Providence in a way`1
about Sheffield, and how we`1
about Sid being shot when`1
about Sid, and Mary, and`1
about Sis, nor any of`1
about Tom, and was all`1
about _you_.  As a general`1
about a Testament.  So I`1
about a bluejay and a`1
about a boy by the`1
about a couple of foot`1
about a dog not eating`1
about a dozen houses there,`1
about a dozen long gasps,`1
about a dozen times, but`1
about a foot deep in`1
about a foot high: then`1
about a foot, showing the`1
about a half a mile`1
about a half a minute,`1
about a half a minute`2
about a half a thought,`1
about a half an hour,`2
about a half an hour`2
about a hundred times as`1
about a hundred yards across`1
about a little, showing there`1
about a man that left`1
about a mile below, and`1
about a mile up a`1
about a mile up stream,`1
about a million wives." `1
about a minute I come`1
about a minute everybody was`1
about a minute somebody spoke`1
about a minute, listening.  Then`1
about a minute. Then she`1
about a month, and then`1
about a quarter of a`4
about a runaway nigger, don't`1
about a thing that ain't`1
about a thousand times as`1
about a week longer.  After`1
about a week!"  Then`1
about a whiting before.' `1
about again, and Alice heard`1
about all I can stand`1
about all kinds of adventures`1
about all kinds of things--we`1
about all the dead people`1
about among those beds of`1
about amongst the passages, and`1
about an hour after dark`1
about an hour ago; then`1
about an hour or two`1
about an hour there wouldn't`1
about an hour trying to`1
about an hour we had`1
about an hour, and then`2
about an inch.  Jim tried`1
about and on the river,`1
about anxiously among the trees,`1
about any runaway nigger, and`1
about any sell.  Go along`1
about anybody coming but him."`1
about anything you choose to`1
about as big as me`1
about as curious as it`1
about as it went, as`1
about as much right,' said`1
about as old as me--thirteen`1
about as ornery.  After breakfast`1
about as she spoke, but`1
about as well the way`1
about at the other end`1
about away off yonder in`1
about bad luck, and so`1
about beat out.  Let's look`1
about brotherly love, and such-like`1
about by mice and rabbits.`1
about cats or dogs either,`1
about children who had got`1
about counted her head off`1
about dark now; so I`1
about dark the canoe was`1
about dark.  While I was`1
about dawn this morning; then`1
about dawn, and was a-going`1
about daybreak I found a`1
about daylight,   moby-006.txt`1
about dead broke, and laid`1
about donations to  `1
about donations to the Project`1
about done loading, and pretty`1
about done.  I give her`1
about driving slow on accounts`1
about easily in any direction,`1
about every little thing that`1
about everybody and everything in`1
about faith and good works`1
about fifteen inches high: she`1
about fifteen minutes, I reckon.`1
about fifteen minutes, and so`1
about fifteen or sixteen foot`1
about fifteen times before he`1
about fifty mile and camp`1
about fifty yards, and says:`1
about fifty yards, and then`1
about fifty-five--and he was a`1
about five minutes, but set`1
about five minutes, picking tallow-drip`1
about five or six inches`1
about five or ten minutes`2
about for a minute or`1
about for it, he was`1
about for some way of`1
about for them, but they`1
about forty foot high. We`1
about forty year old in`1
about forty-five or fifty year`1
about four feet high. 'Whoever`1
about four inches deep and`1
about four or five foot`1
about fourteen--that's the one that`1
about free.  It was according`1
about going aboard, so I`1
about half an hour Aunt`1
about half an hour Tom's`1
about half no time! Take`1
about half-past eleven, and Tom`1
about half-past three.  I judged`1
about her and her husband's`1
about her and to wonder`1
about her any more if`1
about her husband, and about`1
about her now she was`1
about her only whether she`1
about her other little children,`1
about her pet: 'Dinah's our`1
about her relations up the`1
about her repeating 'YOU ARE`1
about her troubles again; and`1
about her, to pass away`1
about her. 'Oh, do let`1
about her.  It _amounted_ to`1
about her?"  "Yes, Miss`1
about here, O Mouse!' (Alice`1
about here?'  'In THAT`1
about hiding the money-bag again.`1
about hiding the raft good.`1
about him, and I don't`1
about him, because I don't`1
about him, not a bit,`1
about him, so he must`1
about him, to a dot--paints`1
about him."  Somebody says:`1
about him."  Then we`1
about him."  Then the old`1
about him; and kept asking`1
about him; but by and`1
about his being free, and`1
about his brother's last moments,`1
about his little boy the`1
about his toes?' the Mock`1
about his troubles, he forgot`1
about his wife and his`1
about his wife and young`1
about how hard times was,`1
about how he was scared.`1
about how it was reckoned`1
about how much better off`1
about how to run in`1
about how we blowed out`1
about in a melancholy way,`1
about in a shuck tick,`1
about in all directions, tumbling`1
about in all my life,`1
about in his saddle; he`1
about in that book, which`1
about in the chimney close`1
about in the first place."`1
about in the pool a`1
about in the pool, 'and`1
about in the wood, 'is`1
about it any more, but`1
about it as anybody did,`1
about it away down the`1
about it before sun-up next`1
about it before, no way.`1
about it in less than`1
about it just at first,`1
about it now, that's a`1
about it nuther."  "Well,"`1
about it right off, because`1
about it while the Mouse`1
about it!'  Last came`1
about it!' and he went`1
about it, Huck.  Po' niggers`1
about it, Jim."  So`1
about it, and I judged`1
about it, and he got`1
about it, and he was`1
about it, and she said`1
about it, and then said,`1
about it, and they said`1
about it, and was out`1
about it, and wouldn't count`1
about it, but after this`1
about it, but me and`1
about it, even if I`1
about it, neither, nor do`1
about it, nor let anybody`1
about it, please.  You'll take`1
about it, so she turned`1
about it, you know--' `1
about it, you may stand`1
about it,' added the Hatter,`1
about it,' said Alice. 'Why?'`1
about it--and so they kept`1
about it--except for the other`1
about it. And yet I`1
about it.  And I wrote`1
about it.  Directly it begun`1
about it.  He's _got_ to`1
about it.  Here she was`1
about it.  Here, Mary Jane,`1
about it.  I judged she`1
about it.  I says to`1
about it.  If he was`1
about it.  Pretty soon I`1
about it.  Prisoners ain't ever`1
about it.  Says I, if`1
about it.  We can get`1
about it.  We can spare`1
about it."  "But it`1
about it."  "Well, you`1
about it."  "Well," says`1
about it."  "Why, I`1
about it."  "_Well_, den!`1
about it."  So she`1
about it.'  'She's in`1
about it.' (The jury all`1
about it: it was neither`1
about it; I won't ever`1
about it; and in less`1
about it; and while she`1
about it; and yet, somehow,`1
about it; but mainly I`1
about it; if I'm Mabel,`1
about it?  It would only`1
about its being a sore`1
about just so it was`1
about kings and dukes and`1
about knee deep, and watched`1
about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted`1
about like mad things all`1
about like that!'  By`1
about like this:  "This`1
about made up my mind`2
about me and Tom Sawyer`1
about me without you have`1
about me, that there ought!`1
about me.   `1
about me.  All right; I`1
about midnight he must a`1
about midnight, they made Jim`1
about my coming back, and`1
about my family--I mean the`1
about myself. This was including`1
about myself; but the old`1
about new eBooks.  `1
about nineteen years old. `1
about nobody ever heard of`1
about noon-time, the girls' joy`1
about nothing else all these`1
about nothing else.  It got`1
about old Miss Watson setting`1
about on the floor, and`1
about once in a minute.`1
about one night longer than`1
about other kings, and let`1
about our Royal Nonesuch rapscallions,`1
about our plans, and how`1
about pap and what a`1
about play-actin', and hain't ever`1
about pretty much everybody and`1
about ravens and writing-desks, which`1
about ready to tumble in.`1
about reforming.  I shoved the`1
about right now.  So I`1
about running daytimes.  We judged`1
about seven thousand), and three`1
about seventy or upwards, and`1
about six foot of him,`1
about six foot wide.  The`1
about six hundred yards, and`1
about six or seven foot.`1
about sixteen, and very sweet`1
about sixty, the other two`1
about snags; the lightning was`1
about snakes.  He said they`1
about some of these things`1
about somebody that was dead,`1
about somebody that was going`1
about something that's on its`1
about something you could touch`1
about something, my dear, and`1
about sometimes, when he wrote`1
about spoiled for her; she`1
about starved.  Then when we`1
about stopping herself before she`1
about such things, Jim would`1
about sundown.  The doctor he`1
about supper, nor ever seemed`1
about temperance and such things`1
about ten a little bit`1
about ten mile below the`1
about ten minutes ago, and`1
about ten o'clock it come`1
about ten we hove in`1
about that dead tanner like`1
about that nigger goes to`1
about that paper and the`1
about that scandalous show, and`1
about that school I'll tan`1
about that school, because he`1
about that way every night`1
about that, because I wanted`1
about that, for pretty soon`1
about that.  Go 'long with`1
about that.  I says: `1
about the Apthorps--which 'll be`1
about the English Wilkses, and`1
about the Mission of Project`1
about the Proctors, but only`1
about the Project Gutenberg Literary`2
about the Wilkses; and about`1
about the bad place, and`1
about the bluest and blackest--_FST_!`1
about the cabin every night,`1
about the cooking.  Then I`1
about the crumbs,' said the`1
about the dead man and`1
about the diseased again, and`1
about the dollar I got`1
about the end of the`1
about the first thing we`1
about the games now.' `1
about the gang, but not`1
about the good place.  She`1
about the harem? Solomon had`1
about the head of the`1

about the men--I reckon I`1
about the middle I heard`1
about the middle of the`1
about the middle we let`1
about the money.  It was`1
about the murder, but the`1
about the new letter, but`1
about the next day.  I`1
about the only way to`1
about the parlor, there was`1
about the rats. You'd see`1
about the reason and all`1
about the right distance--but then`1
about the same height as`1
about the same time.  The`1
about the servant-girl?"  "You'll`1

about the spoon, and says:`1

alive and well and she`1
alive in her.  I pulled`1
alive now, and I was`1
alive with the strange creatures`1

alive, I hope it ain't`1

alive, Mars Tom!  Why, if`1
alive, _Aunt Polly!_"  If`1
alive, and it didn't seem`1
alive, and nobody ever slept`1
alive, and so get so`1
alive, and used to paste`1
alive, thank God!  And that's`1
alive; for instance, there's the`1

all alone here!'  As`1
all alone we had to`1

all amounted to a considerable`1

and they generly landed in`1
and they get to be`1
and they got one.  'Bout`1
and they guessed it would`1
and they had to amputate`1
and they had turned the`1
and they hailed her.  She`1
and they happened to say`1
and they have been trying`1
and they heard us and`1
and they hung on to`1
and they just went away`1
and they kept on piling`1
and they kneeled down and`1
and they laid to their`1
and they laughed again; then`1
and they leaned every which-way,`1

and they warn't so raspy`1
and they warn't the likeliest,`1
and they was all busy`1
and they was bowed and`1
and they was going to`1
and they was just about`1
and they went on for`1
and they worked out somehow,`1
and they would hash you`1
and they would never find`1
and they would rain down`1
and they wouldn't _think_ of`1
and they wouldn't sting me.`1
and they'd be along pretty`1
and they'd make Jim feel`1
and they'd slide right out`1
and they'll think I've been`1
and they're oozing out!" `1
and they're people that ain't`1
and they've got him.  Was`1
and they've got to do`1
and they've took my nigger,`1
and thicker was the wagons`1
and thin, and every day`1
and things all ship-shape and`1
and things begin to feel`1
and things in there good`1
and things that was valuable,`1
and things that went by`1
and things to work with`1
and things, and a hard`1
and things, and nonnamous letters`1
and things, how tedious they've`1
and things, on top of`1
and things, which made it`1
and things.  I said, why`1
and things; and whilst the`1
and think again, I reckoned`1
and think it over some`1
and think, my! how that`1
and think."  I studied`1
and thinking of little Alice`1
and thinking, and never saying`1
and thinking.  Then he turns`1
and thinks he's mighty smart.`1
and thinks it is a`1
and thinks the bed-leg is`1
and this 'n 'll come`1
and this Alice thought decidedly`1
and this Alice would not`1
and this awful mess wouldn't`1
and this he handed over`1
and this is _another_ one`1
and this is his brother`1
and this old rip of`1
and this premature balditude.  Yes,`1
and this time I was`1
and this time I won.`1
and this time he made`1
and this time it vanished`1
and this time worse than`1
and this town for all`1
and this was her dream:--`1
and this was his first`1
and this was of very`1
and those cool fountains, but`1
and though it would take`1
and though this was not`1
and thought 'twas all she`1
and thought it would be`1
and thought to herself that`1
and thought, and pretty soon`1
and thous'n's that ain't nigh`1
and thrashed around this way`1
and thrashed me, but I`1
and thread and all such`1
and thread, and let on`1
and three boxes of seegars.`1
and three invected lines on`1
and three or four dozen`1
and three thousand dollars in`1
and three thousand dollars, gold,`1
and three times they come`1
and through the willows east`1
and through the woods down`1
and throw in the fancy`1
and throw it away, and`1
and throw it out of`1
and throw it out.  You`1
and throw us, with the`1
and throwed his hat down`1
and throwed it out of`1
and throwed the snakes clear`1
and thunder and lighten like`1
and tie him, and keep`1
and tie them around his`1
and tie up right away.`1
and tied hand and foot,`1
and tied him before he`1
and tied him he'd a`1
and tied it under my`1
and tied up some others`1
and tied up the canoe`1
and tied up--nearly always in`1
and tight aground now.  I`1
and till the puppy's bark`1
and tilted over considerable.  We`1
and timidly said 'Consider, my`1
and tin cups, and the`1
and tin plates, and case-knives,`1
and tired him most to`1
and tired, so I laid`1
and tiresome to him when`1
and tiresome; and then the`1
and to blame, somehow--though I`1
and to hear his history.`1
and to her great delight`1
and to keep the things`1
and to make it more`1
and to miss seeing diseased`1
and to stand on their`1
and to wonder what was`1
and tobacco; so we had`1
and told about it, and`1
and told her all what`1
and told her every blame`1
and told her the noise`1
and told him I was`1
and told him all about`1
and told him he could`1
and told him pap was`1
and told him to buy`1
and told him to get`1
and told him to sell`1
and told him to tend`1
and told him to work`1
and told him what they`1
and told him, and laughed,`1
and told him.  He didn't`1
and told his driver to`1
and told me I better`1
and told me all about`1
and told me he was`1
and told me the people`1
and told me the whole`1
and told me to come`2
and told me to mind`1
and told me to say`1
and told somebody."  That was`1
and told the king all`1
and told the widow about`1
and told the young men`1
and told us all to`1
and told where the six`1
and tolerable silly.  They stood`1
and took a good look`1
and took a look at`1
and took a look; but`1
and took a set at`1
and took a swift look`1

another puzzling question; and as`1
another question. 'What sort of`1

anything, but just poked along`1
anything, but she heard a`1

anything, somehow--perfect saphead."  I`1
anything.  'Why,' said the`1
anything.  When he got`1
anything. And by and by`1
anything.  It's only saying, do`1
anything.  There ain't no harm`1
anything; and nobody saying anything`1

anyway."  I didn't hope`1
anyway; and he said there`1
anyway; and yet here's a`1
anyway; because the widow she`1

anyway?  What made you think`1
anyway?"  "Well, some of`1

anywhere I want to. Jackson's`1
anywhere at no cost and`2
anywhere else."  "Well, then,`1
anywhere without a porpoise.' `1
anywhere.  I says:  "Jim!"`1
anywheres where it won't do`1
anywheres--perfectly still--just like the whole`1
anywheres.  I peeped through a`1
anywheres.  Where would I go`1
anywheres; he was clean shaved`1
anywheres; then the nice breeze`1
anywhers, but I couldn't--bank too`1
apart and put it in;`1
apart, and an open camp`1

ashore.  We went to`1

ashore.  Most everybody was on`1

asked me what my name`1

asked no questions, he never`1
asked some stragglers about it,`1
asked the Gryphon, and the`1
asked the Mock Turtle a`1

asked triumphantly.  Alice did`1
asked us considerable many questions;`1
asked, with another dig of`1

get an outfit, and go`1
get any answer out of`1
get any answer; so I`1
get any further than that`1
get any older than I`1

get anything they pray for,`1
get around it.  He`1
get around it?  Jim's _got_`1
get around that noway.  That`1
get ashore and get help`1
get ashore.  So then`1
get at a couple of`1
get at it, and turned`1
get at my britches-pocket.  I`1
get at the window and`1
get at them.  I catched`1
get at.  Now, what do`1
get away I sha'n't be`1
get away and tell Tom`1
get away before he made`1
get away from here till`1
get away from the feuds,`1
get away from the houses,`1
get away from the swamp.`1
get away from the wreck`1
get away with it.  If`1
get away with that bag`1
get away with that tooth`1
get away with, Tom said;`1
get away without being seen,`1
get away, and then I'd`1
get away, but a lot`1
get away, but get took`1
get away.  Anyway, he set`1
get away.  I didn't want`1
get away.  So I never`1
get away; but nothing would`1

get down the river a`1
get down there, too, if`1
get drownded; and if he`1
get drunk on.  Then in`1
get dry again: they had`1
get dry very soon. `1
get entirely shut of them.`1
get far enough off before`1
get fetched such a solid`1
get further ahead and clear`1
get further, and when he`1
get help and nab them,`1
get help somehow. I was`1
get help; and he got`1
get her head down to`1
get her head through the`1
get her to take a-holt`1
get here before eleven put`1

get here?"  "Because it`1
get here?"  He looked`1
get him a hot breakfast`1
get him back to the`1

get in at the window.'`1
get in, so I was`1

get in; and when I`1
get in?'  'There might`1
get in?' asked Alice again,`1
get in?' she repeated, aloud.`1
get into her eyes--and still`1
get into no trouble.  If`1
get into that beautiful garden--how`1
get into the garden, and`1
get into the ring--said he`1
get into trouble sure. `1
get into trouble with Aunt`1
get into trouble with _us_,`1
get into trouble you send`1
get into with quarrelsome people`1
get it again, and it`1
get it done."  He`1
get it hitched on good."`1
get it home?' when it`1
get it in two; then`1
get it out of my`1
get it out of there,`1
get it through my head`1
get it when it floats`1
get it, and nobody don't`1
get it, then?"  "Gets`1
get it. Is your husband`1
get it.  But it warn't`1
get it; but that ain't`1
get it?"  "Why, no."`1
get left on this wreck`1
get loose when there's a`1
get loose."  "How you`1
get married to dat young`1
get me and Jim rid`1
get me away from him`1
get me executed, as sure`1
get me out of their`1
get me.  He said he`1
get mellow enough to forget`1

get my breath for most`1
get my mouth to tell`1
get my words out, I`1
get nearly to them they`1
get no money.  It's just`1
get no other kind out`1
get no show, Mrs. Phelps`1
get no show."  "Never`1
get no track of Tom;`1
get none from home, because`1
get off.  So I told`1
get on a steamboat and`1
get on better.'  'I'd`1
get on the raft and`1
get one of us, sure,`1
get ourselves out of prison`1
get out again.  Suddenly`1
get out again.  The`1
get out all the niggers`1

get out of the way;`1

get people to do something,`1
get pretty fur till the`1

get some more.  I didn't`1
get some of them again.`1
get some sleep; and next`1
get some whisky; said he`1
get some, and found a`1
get some.  When we`1
get somebody to go for`1

get started on it; so`1
get strong, and then he`1
get that all right; but`1
get that money; and the`1
get that out of my`1

get took up along with`1
get towards our house I`1
get under in blazing weather`1
get under the bed.  But`1
get up a difficult plan.`1
get up and cook breakfast.`1
get up and down the`1
get up and leave the`1
get up and watch the`1

get us as long as`1
get us away from him.`1

get used to it in`1
get used up.'  'But`1
get very tired of sitting`1

gets here."  Well, the`1
gets leveler and leveler all`1

gets up, a-wondering, and goes`1
getting 'em out.  Go 'long`1

getting lynched.  But before night`1
getting mighty thin sometimes.  She`1
getting more and more outrageous`1
getting on now, my dear?'`1
getting on?' said the Cat,`1
getting out of the room`1

getting people and things all`1
getting pretty sultry for us,`1
getting quite crowded with the`1
getting run over and catched`1
getting run over; but we`1
getting slow and dull, and`1
getting so I liked the`1
getting so far off). 'Oh,`1
getting so thin--and the twinkling`1
getting so uneasy I couldn't`1

her eyes towards the road`1
her eyes was all lit`1

her eyes--and still as she`1
her eyes; and once she`1
her face afire like sunset,`1
her face and her eyes`1
her face brightened up at`1
her face in her hands,`1
her face like the three`1

her face, and was beating`1
her face, with such a`1

her face.  'Wake up,`1
her face; she was a`1

her flamingo, and began an`1

her float wherever the current`1
her float.   I laid`1
her foot as far down`1
her foot slipped, and in`1
her foot!  She was`1
her foot, that there was`1
her for a moment like`1
her for fifteen before, and`1
her friend's house, Miss What-you-may-call-her`1

her good till she was`1
her good, and she was`1
her good, and then, 'stead`1
her great delight it fitted!`1
her great disappointment it was`1
her greatest picture when she`1
her hair all combed up`1
her hair all down her`1
her hair goes in such`1
her half way; and then`1
her hand again, and made`1
her hand in her pocket,`1
her hand on the top`1
her hand, and Alice guessed`1
her hand, and made a`1
her hand, and says: `1
her hand, and she was`1
her hand, singing out, "Begone`1
her hand, watching the setting`1
her hand; and behind her`1
her handkerchief, and I see`1
her hands on her lap`1
her hands up to her`1
her hands up; and as`1
her hands, and began:-- `1
her hands, and says: `2
her hands, and she set`1
her hands, and was surprised`1
her hands, crying.  I felt`1
her hands, wondering if anything`1
her haste, she had put`1

her head and grumble a`1
her head around slow, and`1
her head down to them,`1
her head impatiently; and, turning`1
her head in the lap`1

her head off for the`1
her head on her hand,`1
her head pressing against the`1
her head struck against the`1
her head this way or`1
her head through the doorway;`1
her head to feel which`1
her head to keep back`1
her head to stabboard!"  I`1
her head up like a`1
her head was so full`1

her head!'  Alice glanced`1
her head!' Those whom she`1
her head!' about once in`1
her head!' the Queen shouted`1
her head!'  And they chop`1
her head'--and they chop it`1
her head, and knotted there`1
her head, and she had`1
her head, she tried to`1
her head. 'If I eat`1
her head. Still she went`1
her head.'  And he made`1
her hedgehog.  The hedgehog`1
her here.' And the executioner`1
her hid; and then I`1
her hips and every gentleman`1
her hips, and she looking`1
her hoisted boats, an American`1
her home, but it was`1
her how to meddle.  And`1
her husband to fetch a`1
her husband would be in`1
her husband's matters.  But she`1
her husband, and about her`1
her husband.  "Good-_ness_ gracious!"`1
her idea of the tale`1
her if I'd a been`1
her if she reckoned Tom`1
her if she'd a said`1

her in a good place?"`1
her in a languid, sleepy`1
her in an angry tone,`1
her in and hide her`1
her in good shape, she`1
her in such a pleasant`1
her in the coals, and`1
her in the face. 'I'll`1

her insurrection all by herself,`1
her into a little creek`1

her knee, and the bright`1
her knees apart; she don't`1
her knowledge of history, Alice`1
her knowledge, as there was`1
her knowledge. 'Just think of`1
her knuckles on her hips`1
her lap as if she`1
her lap she throws her`1
her lap, and had her`1
her lessons in the schoolroom,`1
her life before, and she`1
her life, and had come`1
her life. Indeed, she had`1
her life; and wouldn't believe`1
her life; it was all`1
her life; she druther die`1
her lights would wink out`1
her lips. 'I know SOMETHING`1
her little shiny eyes, and`1
her little sister's dream. `1
her little white children, acting`1
her look too spidery, seemed`1
her look up in a`1

her loose!  Glory be to`1
her loose, Jim! we're all`1
her mind made up, and`1
her mind that she had`1

her money!  Then Susan`1
her money.  And when she`1

her mouth, and underneath the`1
her mouth; but she did`1
her my father and mother`1
her name--and they lost their`1
her neck from being broken.`1
her neck kept getting entangled`1
her neck with a feather`1
her neck would bend about`1
her next remark. 'Then the`1
her nigger go off right`1
her nigger woman in the`1
her night-gown and her ruffled`1

her nose in shore," says`1
her nose to shore; then`1
her nostrils spread and her`2
her now she was gone;`1
her now that I warn't`1
her of her money! `2
her of her money.  And`1
her off, and says: `1
her off.  She was about`1
her old gray head was`1
her old hair trunk, which`1
her on the back of`1
her once more, while the`1
her one more turn for`1
her one, they gave him`1
her only whether she was`1
her or of anything else.`1
her other hand hanging down`1
her other hand with its`1
her other little children, and`1
her out and float her`1
her out to about the`1
her out, and then pulled`1
her out, private, and took`1
her over very nice and`1
her own child-life, and the`1
her own children.  'How`1
her own courage. 'It's no`1
her own ears for having`1
her own head. It was`1
her own mind (as well`1
her own roof, shaming her`1
her own room to Uncle`1
her own self when she`1
her own self."  "I`1

her pet: 'Dinah's our cat.`1
her pictures had been aggravating`1
her place, and I might`1

her pocket, and pulled out`1
her poor old scrap-book and`1
her pounding along, but we`1
her powerful pretty.  I was`1
her powwow shut off and`1
her prayer to be allowed`1
her promise.  'Treacle,' said`1
her promise.  Then I told`1
her question. 'Why did they`1
her rather inquisitively, and seemed`1
her reach at the Duchess`1
her relations down the river,`1
her relations up the river,`1
her repeating 'YOU ARE OLD,`1
her right elbow, under a`1
her riper years, the simple`1
her room and shut the`1
her room if they was`1
her room, and every time`1

her saucer of milk at`1
her saying she would pray`1
her see that corpse laying`1
her sentence three of the`1
her setting there by her`1
her sharp little chin into`1
her sharp little chin. `1
her shingle nail, before noon.`1
her shoulders were nowhere to`1
her shovel about a thing`1
her side holding a white`1
her side. She was walking`1
her silky hand on mine`1
her silver snuffbox that was`1
her since that time that`1
her since, but I reckon`1
her sister kissed her, and`1
her sister on the bank,`1
her sister sat still just`1
her sister was reading, but`1
her sister, Miss Sophia, but`1
her sister, as well as`1
her sister, who was gently`1
her sister; 'Why, what a`1
her sisters and sleep on`1
her sixteen or seventeen times--and`1
her size.  But I bet`1
her skirt, upsetting all the`1
her slide!"  So in`1
her so mean?  Why, she`1
her so savage when they`1
her so!"   `1
her something about the games`1
her something worth hearing. For`1
her son, and allowed she`1
her soul out about it,`1
her spectacles, and began staring`1
her spectacles--kind of grinding him`1
her spinning-stick in her hand;`1
her stockings.  It was very`1
her surprise, when the White`1
her swim in the pool,`1
her temper.  'Are you`1
her than any girl I`1
her that Sid was all`1
her that Tom and _Sid_`1
her that she might as`1
her that she ought to`1

her the wink she'd light`1
her thimble with the other,`1
her time being grateful we`1
her to begin.' He looked`1
her to carry it further.`1
her to ever count them`1
her to find out what`1
her to let me think`1
her to say she wouldn'`1

her to take a-holt of`1

her to wink with one`1

her toes when they passed`1
her tongue could go, every`1
her tongue was a-going all`1
her too much, so she`1
her troubles again; and I`1
her try and repeat something`1
her turn or not. So`1
her two young women which`1
her uncle Hornback would want`1
her uncle Hornback--"  "Great`1
her uncle Peter would ruther`1
her uncle, and he'd fix`1
her uncle?  Looky here, you`1
her uncles was come. The`1
her unfortunate guests to execution--once`1
her up and got her`1
her up in my arms,`1
her up in spite of`1
her up like everything, of`1
her up with rag rope,`1
her up, and this awful`1
her up, every last sign`1
her up. Next morning, 'Chop`1
her upper deck above water,`1
her usual height.  It`1
her very distinct.  She was`1
her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah,`1
her very much at first,`1
her very much of a`1
her violently with its wings.`1
her voice close to her`1
her voice sounded hoarse and`1
her voice, and see that`1
her voice. Nobody moved. `1
her waiting!' Alice felt so`1
her was another long passage,`1
her was; but dey warn't`1
her waves would get to`1
her way into a tidy`1
her way out. 'I shall`1
her way through the wood.`1
her way, and she allowed`1
her way; but when she`1
her ways; and so when`1
her what the paper was`1
her what would make her`1
her where I could find`1
her whoop to Jericho.  You`1
her will."  "Then what`1
her will; and so, sure`1
her with dough, and set`1
her with large round eyes,`1
her with.  I held up`1
her wonderful Adventures, till she`1
her yawl, and we went`1
her,    `1
her, 'if we had the`1
her, I judge.  You may`1
her, I says:  "'Shet`1
her, Jim."  But Jim`1
her, about a quarter of`1
her, about four inches deep`1
her, about the same height`1
her, and I found a`1
her, and I said I`1
her, and cried over her,`1
her, and her back was`1
her, and look as happy`1
her, and most hugged the`1
her, and no use to`1
her, and not say nothing`1
her, and said how bad`1
her, and said, 'It WAS`1
her, and she trembled till`1
her, and she'd stretch out`1
her, and shook his head,`1
her, and so she'd sell`1
her, and the Queen said`1
her, and took a set`1
her, and we was safe,`1
her, but I couldn't, only`1
her, but I was so`1
her, but just then the`1
her, calling out in a`1
her, down here, and I'm`1
her, it didn't make no`1
her, leaning her head on`1
her, listening: so she went`1
her, maybe."  "No, don't`1
her, one on each side,`1
her, she began, in a`1
her, sir?"  "Why, no;`1
her, so she took courage,`1
her, still it was good`1
her, they hurried back to`1
her, though, as they all`1
her, to pass away the`1
her, when she warn't noticing,`1
her,' said the Mock Turtle`1
her--said she was big enough`1
her.  'Collar that Dormouse,'`1
her.  'I wish you`1
her.  'What CAN all`1
her.  'Yes!' shouted Alice.`1
her.  Alice caught the`1
her.  I sung out`1
her.  There was nothing`1
her.  Well, there was`1
her. 'I can hardly breathe.'`1
her. 'I've something important to`1
her. 'Oh, do let me`1
her. 'Poor little thing!' said`1
her. She is such a`1
her. The Cat seemed to`1
her. Then followed the Knave`1
her.  "It ain't right nor`1
her.  And she hain't sweated`1
her.  Boggs and the men`1
her.  Everybody said:  "Oh,`1
her.  I felt ever so`1
her.  I got up and`1
her.  I pulled all around`1
her.  If anybody can persuade`1
her.  It _amounted_ to something`1
her.  She says:  "Why,`1
her.  She sent out her`1
her.  She was very deep,`1
her.  So she run on:`1
her.  So she took and`1
her.  The lightning showed her`1
her.  You slide in, in`1
her."  "Well, I'll learn`1
her."  I didn't have`1
her: first, because the Duchess`1
her: its face was quite`1
her: she gave a little`1
her: the last time she`1
her: then, saying to herself`1
her; 'but those serpents! There's`1
her; and said she'd like`1
her; and the baby was`1
her; and when I folded`1
her; and when she next`1
her; she didn't know _how_`1
her?"  "How I gwyne`1
her?"  "Yes, Miss Mary`1
her?"  I couldn't think`1
here 'f it hadn't a`1
here Alice began to get`1
here I am in the`1
here I told Jim to`1
here I've been, night after`1
here a minute ago." `1
here again, for I found`1
here all night.  Take off`1
here all the time." `1
here am I, forlorn, torn`1
here and feel of me`1
here and hunt up her`1
here and listen tell I`1
here and there she saw`1
here and there. There was`1
here and there.  He hopped`1
here and there."  So`1
here and wait the three`1
here and wonder what has`1
here any longer!'  She`1
here any minute, and sings`1
here at a farm; so`1

him free in her will."`1
him free--me and Tom.  We`1

him get ashore.  So`1
him give up that money,`1
him give up the money;`1

him have it; because I`1
him he could cure anybody`1

him he wanted done. `1
him he'd a killed us`1
him he'd come down the`1
him heaps of good, and`1
him here in the canoe,`1
him his fan and gloves--that`1
him home for hours, till`1
him home late last night`1
him how Harvey 'd showed`1
him how glad he was`1
him how to keep a`1
him how to make it`1
him how unregular it would`1
him howdy."  But they`1
him if he done that!"`1
him if he'd been imagining`1
him if he'd seen a`1
him if there warn't any`1
him in a butt of`1
him in a low voice,`1
him in a pan." `1
him in a pie; it's`1
him in a trance, and`1
him in advance; they were`1
him in enough stomach-ache to`1
him in the back room`1
him in the back. At`1
him in the doggery the`1
him in the leg, and`1
him in the lightning my`1
him in the wigwam and`2
him in the woods about`1
him into an old trap`1
him into camp.  I`1
him into slavery again.  Says`1
him into the court, arm-in-arm`1
him into the earth, you`1
him into the river.  Now`1
him into town with a`1
him is named Abram Foster--Abram`1
him it would be one`1
him just how to find`1
him keep back--if he shows`1
him killed, and I've got`1
him know she liked them`1
him know when the men`1
him knows that he would`1
him last.  So he set`1
him like a picture, and`1
him looking hearty and healthy,`1
him loose! he ain't no`1
him low,    Young Stephen`1
him mad, and he begun`1
him mad, and he said`1
him mark the places on`1
him me and my brother`1
him mine.  He flung it`1
him more good than most`1
him most of the time.`1
him most to death, and`1
him mostly in the dark,`1
him next time.  And he`1
him no more mean tricks,`1
him no more.  Then`1
him no more.  He used`1
him no more.  I begged,`1
him not laying late and`1
him not to hurt Harvey's`1
him not to talk that`1
him off of his horse`1
him off with the gun,`1
him off! he's biting me`1
him off! take him off!`1
him on the bank.  But`1
him on the cheek--but I`1
him on the floor and`1
him on the road, didn't`1
him one without _him_ knowing`1
him open them; and we`1
him open with my saw,`1
him or outrun him most`1
him out and emptied Him"  `1
him out and emptied him;`1
him out and rush him`1
him out and says: `1

him out of his troubles."`1
him out through a lot`1

him out, and we slid`1
him out, are we?" `1
him out, but he wouldn't`1

him out.  It 'll take`1
him out.  We never got`1
him over and over again,`1
him over and over again`1
him over de head--dat is,`1
him over everybody; and next`1
him over like he never`1

him perfectly easy."  It`1
him plain "Bridgewater," which, he`1
him pretty clear, because there`1
him pretty keen. But he`1
him pull a skiff over`1

him, and always called him`1
him, and asking him if`1
him, and called him cry-baby,`1
him, and chained him again,`1
him, and curled him up`1

him, she can."  So`1
him, skasely; and when there`1
him, so he must hurry`1
him, so to speak.  And`1
him, sure.  So that cooled`1
him, take up a collection!"`1
him, that would do him`1
him, the ignorant tramp, with`1
him, to a dot--paints him`1
him, to keep from getting`1
him, too; because I thought`1
him, too; but I reckon`1
him, too; but Jim didn't`1
him, we went along, but`1
him, which was blame' foolishness,`1
him, you by the hedge!'`1
him, you know; everything will`1
him, you see; and while`1
him," I says.  "No`1
him,' said Alice desperately: 'he's`1
him,' the Mock Turtle said`1
him,) 'I'll give him sixpence.`1
him--How was it, old fellow?`1
him--I hain't ever heard anything`1
him--a man's own son, which`1
him--and didn't he kill old`1
him--it was for bringing the`1
him--oh, here he is himself.`1
him--three hundred dollars.  And there's`1
him.  "Do I know`1
him.  "Run her nose`1
him.  '--or next day,`1
him.  But the old`1
him.  He jumped up`1
him.  Next morning I`1
him.  The judge and`1
him.  They cussed Jim`1
him.  Well, by and`1
him.  When breakfast was`1
him. 'A nice muddle their`1
him. But it didn't save`1
him. By and by he`1
him. Children, don't you say`1
him. He made me take`1
him. He run off f'm`1
him. I am to be`1
him. It takes up more`1
him. Mars Tom, I's willin'`1
him. Of course I _wanted_`1
him. So he took him`1
him. Well, _wasn't_ he mad?`1
him.  And he said that`1
him.  And tell him to`1
him.  And they call _that_`1
him.  But before they got`1
him.  But it warn't so`1
him.  En mo' en dat,`1
him.  He didn't know what`1
him.  He dropped below me`1
him.  He got up and`1
him.  He wore out by`1
him.  He's dressed, and everything's`1
him.  He's told some stretchers,`1
him.  He--"  "Oh, don't`1
him.  I borrowed three dollars`1
him.  I poked into the`1
him.  I says:  "Hello,`1
him.  I waited, and it`1
him.  I was good and`1
him.  I'm unfavorable to killin'`1
him.  If I never learnt`1
him.  It kind of made`1
him.  It's like picking up`1
him.  Jim didn't like the`1
him.  Mrs. Phelps she jumps`1
him.  My conscience got to`1
him.  Next time you roust`1
him.  One man asked me`1
him.  One uv 'em is`1
him.  Sally, it's terrible--just terrible--something's`1
him.  Says I to myself,`1
him.  Shore's you're born, he'll`1
him.  So I told the`1
him.  So Jim he was`1
him.  So he thought and`1
him.  So now I got`1
him.  So when we see`1
him.  Some think old Finn`1
him.  That _would_ be a`1
him.  The judge said he`1
him.  The king he reads`1
him.  The king sings out:`1
him.  The whoops was warnings`1
him.  Then he give us`1
him.  Then they all agreed`1
him.  Then we whirled in`1
him.  There was heaps of`1
him.  Was you looking for`1
him.  We didn't have no`1
him.  Well, it _was_ pap,`1
him.  Yes, it was mortification--that`1
him."  "It's because it`1
him."  "Singular dream," he`1
him."  "Well, I _reckon_!`1
him."  "Why didn't you`1
him."  "Why, are they`1
him."  So I promised,`1
him."  Somebody says: `1
him."  Then we took`1
him."  Tom's most well`1
him." He turns around and`1
him."  And whilst the nigger`1
him."  Then the old man`1
him:    She`1
him: and even Stigand, the`1
him: the March Hare moved`1
him; "we'll try and get`1
him; and I'll make him`1
him; and a lot of`1
him; and by and by`1
him; and he was that`1
him; and hugged him and`1
him; and kept asking me`1
him; and near the King`1
him; and said he was`1
him; and she says: `1
him; and then they shook`1
him; and when I reckoned`1
him; but by and by`1
him; but he don't mind`1
him; but he shut me`1
him; but he turned around`1
him; but husband's going over`1
him; but the minute we`1
him; but when he says`1
him; for, says I, a`1
him; he set there a-looking`1
him; his meat's as white`1
him; oh, it's too, too`1
him; so I says, I`1
him; so at last he`1
him; so he was satisfied,`1
him; so they had it,`1
him; then that other man's`1
him; then the king and`1
him;    Alas it was`1
him?"  "I can't imagine,"`1
him?"  "It was an`1
him?"  "No.  Didn't you?"`1
him?"  "No; but I`1
him?"  "Well, hain't he`1
him?"  "You bet I`1
him?"  I says, and begun`1
himself Richard III.; and the`1
himself a shame, and his`1
himself and back again and`1
himself and hove off the`1
himself and not tied it`1
himself and set down.  It`1
himself as he came, 'Oh!`1
himself at his own expense,`1

himself down on the blanket`1
himself ever so friendly; and`1
himself free and easy, and`1
himself generly.  But by`1
himself he busted into the`1

himself in a back yard,`1
himself in an undertone, `1
himself in there from outside,`1
himself like Tom Sawyer in`1
himself loose and goes to`1
himself of the mild, `1
himself on the river side`1
himself out so that he`1
himself out that way; how`1
himself out with?  Now I`1
himself suddenly: the others looked`1
himself talk, and every little`1
himself to death.  On`1
himself up and slobbers out`1
himself up for another speech.`1
himself up in his blanket`1
himself up like a liberty-pole,`1
himself up regardless.  Shove along,`1
himself upon tiptoe, put his`1
himself, and this he handed`1
himself, and yet he didn't`1
himself, but that is what`1
himself, has stopped a stage`1
himself, nor nothing?  Why, you'd`1
himself, out of his own`1
himself. And I _did_ start`1
himself. Jim he never let`1
himself.  Buck, take this little`1
himself.  Col.  Grangerford was very`1
himself.  I didn't take notice`1
himself.  Jim cleaned up the`1
himself.  Of course he would`1
himself.  Somebody sings out: `1
himself."  "No--is that so?"`1
himself: '"WE KNOW IT TO`1
himself; but we wouldn't let`1

his hand, thinking.  Pretty soon`1
his hand.  Well, I was`1

his head!' she said, without`1
his head, and a crooked-handled`1
his head, and his head`1
his head, and opened another`1
his head, and said he`1
his head, and wouldn't let`1
his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How`1
his head.  And he`1
his head. But at any`1
his head.  He grabbed his`1
his head; then sighs again,`1
his heart and out of`1
his heart would break. She`1
his heart, and after a`1
his heart; 'n' here so`1
his heels and walked off.`1
his heels flying in the`1
his hick'ry, and I couldn't`1
his history,'  As they`1
his history. I must go`1
his horse and got behind`1
his horse before him to`1
his horse both went home`1
his horse easy and looking`1
his horse so they could`1
his horse, whooping and yelling`1
his horse.  He was a-reeling`1
his housemaid,' she said to`1
his idea about how to`1
his idea, time of the`1
his idiotic Greek and Hebrew,`1
his inscription and coat of`1
his inscription to leave behind,`1
his island, so I tramped`1
his jaw again, and says`1
his jokes the minute he`1
his journal whilst the ink`1
his kind of people is`1
his knee, and looking at`1
his knees sound asleep; so`1
his knees, and put his`1
his knees, and puts his`1
his knees, asleep, with his`1
his knees, moaning and mourning`1
his knees.  I gave his`1
his knife under him, and`1
his knife, and fried him.`1
his knuckles. It was opened`1
his lantern on a nail`1
his lantern, and got his`1
his last act.  And wouldn't`1
his last great novel. `1
his lawsuit and get the`1
his left arm and cocking`1
his left arm in two`1
his left foot all of`1
his left hand," says the`1
his left shoulder as much`1
his leg off for, anyway?"`1
his leg with right away,`1
his leg.  When me`1
his leg.  Why, drat it,`1
his leg; but by and`1
his legs dangle in the`1
his legs out till one`1
his legs; and then he`1
his letters; and so he`1
his level best with the`1
his level pisonest, up there`1
his life before.  Just see`1
his life for a texas`1
his life he put on`1
his life trying to turn`1
his life, and amongst strangers,`1
his life, and so has`1
his life, and the most`1
his life--and then he begun`1
his life.  He got so`1
his life; and I do`1
his life; and, poor as`1
his life; but now he`1
his line.  He got`1
his liquor begun to work`1
his little boy the dolphin,`1
his little front porch, with`1
his little old monthly drunk;`1
his long, mixed-up whiskers.  There`1
his lost time, and write`1
his luck, for inside of`1
his ma and all of`1
his ma, and didn't want`1
his man, and they set`1
his mark. The judge said`1
his marster didn' know it;`1
his meaning, and jumps for`1
his meat's as white as`1
his might for joy, and`1
his might, and so tight`1
his might, and throwed his`1
his might, for he was`1
his might; and every now`1
his mighty bulk the whale`1
his mind which one for`1
his mind, and was coming`1
his mind, because he reckoned`1
his mind, but it didn't`1
his mind.  And so he`1
his mind.  So, along in`1
his money back a hund'd`1
his money was hid, and`1
his mother in disguise, and`2
his mother.  I'll hook a`1
his motto was, "Meat first,`1
his mouth close to her`1
his mouth opened up like`1
his mouth somebody over in`1
his mouth with his hands,`1
his mouth--and we went creeping`1
his mouth--what then?  If he`1
his name and sorrows on`1
his name blotted off of`1
his name in blood." `1
his name is _Jim_--old Miss`1
his name was William Thompson--and`1
his name, and mentioned all`1
his natural rest that morning,`1
his natural self.  He said`1
his neck and come back.`1
his neck on a watch-guard`1
his neck out about a`1
his neck out towards the`1
his neck with a string,`1
his neck, and bust his`1
his neck, and his heels`1
his neck, and we crawled`1
his neck, with first one`1
his neighbour to tell him.`1
his new coat for a`1
his new white beaver and`1
his next move will be`1
his niece all safe before`1
his nieces would be glad`1
his nose   Trims`1
his nose I let drive,`1
his nose out of a`1
his nose out.  I told`1
his nose, and broke to`1
his nose, you know?' `1
his nostrils opening and shutting`1
his note-book hastily. 'Consider your`1
his note-book, cackled out 'Silence!'`1
his oars.  I didn't`1
his old Aunt Polly, and`1
his old coat in the`1
his old granny said his`1
his old limber legs was`1
his old woman--she would think`1
his outfit; it was just`1
his own by him, but`1
his own clothes on him,`1
his own country and amongst`1
his own expense, for a`1
his own father and let`1
his own father dying about`1
his own folks."  I`1
his own hands, and told`1
his own head, and never`1
his own head--three verses--kind of`1
his own head.  He said,`1
his own house, and dressed`1
his own letters and mine`1
his own men!  He had`1
his own self afterwards.  He`1
his own self!  `1
his own self.  I reckon`1
his own self.  S'e, what`1
his own self; so then`1
his own way.  Dey's two`1
his owner come, or he`1
his owner would turn up`1
his pangs might take. In`1
his pard, and his eye`1
his pardon."  She done`1
his part by heart. `1
his people as white folks`1
his people very well.  Yes,`1
his people.  How would you`1
his pipe, and went to`1
his pistol on to the`1
his place it would make`1
his place over against the`1
his place.  You could see`1
his plans set.  So`1
his plate.  Alice did`1
his plates."  "That ain't`1
his pocket, and examined them,`1
his pocket, and says: `1
his pocket, and was looking`1
his pocket.  "It's a`1
his pocket.  She stopped, with`1
his pocket.  Then we went`1
his pockets bulging, or something`1
his pockets, and then went`1
his pommel.  I had seen`1
his poor brother laying yonder`1
his poor brother to lose`1
his preaching, and it was`1
his presence till he asked`1
his promise to ole Jim."`1
his raft he'd kill me,`1
his raft was just a`1
his rascality and ungratefulness for`1
his rat-holes."  There was`1
his record."  So whilst`1
his remark, with variations. 'I`1
his right arm hanging over`1
his right arm in a`1
his right hand, you would`1
his right hand--not aiming it,`1
his right mind 's a`1
his right mind.  So`1
his right mind; then she`1
his right; and so, as`1
his rightful owner; but it`1
his rights in a govment`1
his rights, and got down`1
his room acting that way--said`1
his room and begun to`1
his room he got me`1
his saddle-bags, and we started.`1
his saddle.  All the men`1

his screw-driver.  I was in`1

his shoes off.  'Give`1

his shoulder as he spoke,`1
his shoulder on a bar`1
his shoulder two or three`1
his shoulder with some curiosity.`1
his shoulder, and "$200 reward"`1
his shoulder, and cried down`1
his shoulder, and says, "Too`1
his shoulders showing over the`1
his shoulders. His hands was`1
his shrill little voice, the`1
his shroud on.  I tucked`1
his side.  That old gentleman`1

his slate with one finger,`1
his sleep, 'that "I breathe`1
his smile and looking surprised.`1
his softy soothering ways, putting`1
his solemn talk where he`1

his sorrowful life. 3.  Here`1
his spectacles and looked anxiously`1
his spectacles. 'Where shall I`1

his speech, he howled, and`1
his spies that next day`1
his spondulicks and as much`1
his stand, perfectly ca'm and`1

his stomach.  So for a`1
his store clothes on, and`1
his story.   `1
his straw tick and sleep`1
his straw tick, and scratched`1
his tail and see him`1
his tail. 'As if I`1
his tale, and her nostrils`1

his teacup instead of the`1

his theater paint and painted`1
his thin face, and he`1
his throat cut, and then`1
his throat with the axe,`1
his throat,' said the Gryphon:`1

his toes leaking out of`1

his toes; and the cussing`1
his toes?' the Mock Turtle`1
his tongue just _went_ it--she`1
his tongue to, and the`1
his tongue, and scrawled off`1
his tracks in the snow.`1
his troubles, he forgot all`1
his troubles."  "So'm I,"`1
his troubles; so when he`1
his true friend, and let`1
his turn; and both creatures`1
his two brothers was killed,`1
his usual rubbage, and at`1
his valley--meaning me.  So`1
his very heart to think`1
his voice, and, with tears`1
his voice. 'Same as if`1
his voice; and the two`1
his wardrobe to dig himself`1
his watch out of his`1

his wife, which was owned`1
his wives.  Don't you know`1
his wool was all tied`1
his wool with; and then`1
his word.  I judged he`1
his words out with all`1
his work, and so he`1
his wrist, too.  He said`1
his writing declined, Melville sailed`1
his yarn, and they made`1
his'n on, and he told`1
his'n out of the brass`1
his'n, 'stead of calling me,`1

histories about children who had`1

home Aunt Sally was that`1
home a Shepherdson or bust.`1
home a heap too quick`1
home again--tell them you've thought`1
home all safe.  `1
home and amongst strangers that`1
home and crawl in a`1
home and get them ready`1
home and got drunk and`1
home and know I was`1
home and meet next week,`1
home and prays for a`1
home and upstairs there was`1
home any more."  "Well,`1
home before in his life;`1
home for hours, till he's`1
home in a week or`1
home in the morning anyway.`1
home in the morning, sure;`1
home lasted me all the`1
home late last night and`1
home late to supper, and`1
home like a raft, after`1
home no mo'; so I's`1
home now to take out`1
home on a steamboat, in`1
home pretty leaky and crippled,`1
home so as to get`1
home that had characters; and`1
home the house was all`1
home there as long as`1
home this evening and surprise`1
home this moment, and fetch`1
home through the woods.  The`1
home to England as fast`1
home to bed, with hands`1
home to his ma, and`1
home to me before, what`1
home to the raft we`1
home to the town. `1
home where his family was,`1
home with them; and that`1
home! Why, I wouldn't say`1
home, and I warn't feeling`1
home, and I went to`1
home, and advise everybody to`1
home, and had such a`1
home, and tell all about`1
home, because it's likely pap's`1
home, but it was a`1
home, or canoe it, when`1
home,' thought poor Alice, 'when`1
home--and one of 'em was`1
home--better, maybe, because it was`1
home--he must go right away.`1
home-knit galluses--no, he only had`1
home.  I clumb up`1
home.  While we laid`1
home. About this time I`1
home.  He was very sorry`1
home.  The old gentleman's eyes`1
home.  We begun to come`1

home."  So then we`1
home; and if she is,`1
home; so Harvey 'll know`1

homeless and friendless, after thirty-seven`1
homely and more pleasanter for`1
homesick; because he hadn't ever`1
honest about it; I won't`1
honest and bully.  Then`1
honest and fair; if you`1
honest day's work:  and hungry?--oh,`1
honest life again, and will`1
honest man.'  There was`1
honest one that wants to`1
honest, like servants in England.`1
honest--but don't leave us, please.`1
honest.  I come nigh getting`1
honest.  I won't say I`1

it for breakfast!  Cut loose`1
it for breakfast, have it`1

it for me; he was`1
it for ourselves.  So we`1

it for the few days`1

it for the whole world;`1
it for to hold it`1

it from the pig, and`1
it from them; and I`1

it much either, for I`1

it off a long time,`1
it off and it lit`1
it off from: that he`1

it on to the raft`1

it on, and blowed out`1
it on, and shoved it`1
it on, maybe.  After`1

it was all done with`1

it was all ridges and`1
it was all right enough`1
it was all right now,`2
it was all right, and`2
it was all right.  He`1
it was all right; and`1
it was all she could`1
it was all shriveled up.`1
it was all still and`1
it was all the money`1
it was all the more`1
it was all this happened`1
it was all up with`3

it was always lively, he`1
it was an honor; but`1
it was an uncomfortably sharp`1
it was any way to`1
it was as bright as`1
it was as much as`1
it was astonishing, the way`1
it was at the south`1
it was awful dark for`1
it was awful funny. The`1
it was awful to see.`1
it was awful.  Hines he`1
it was bare and smooth,`1
it was because I warn't`1
it was because I was`1
it was bedtime the old`1
it was before, but I`1
it was beginning to come`1

it was for. Tom said`1
it was found  `1
it was getting earlier now,`1
it was getting pretty sultry`1
it was getting slow and`1

it was good manners for`1
it was good practice to`1
it was good to have`1
it was good to hear;`1
it was good to see;`1
it was good, and then`1
it was good, he whispers`1
it was good.  He said`1
it was ground--hard packed, and`1
it was growing, and she`1
it was he said to`1
it was he'd planned to`1
it was her prayer to`1

it was here, because I`1
it was hid with a`1

it was him, anyway; said`1
it was him; but husband's`1
it was his last act.`1
it was impossible to say`1
it was in Clumbus's time,`1
it was in March.' As`1
it was in front of`1

it was just sickening; and`1
it was just wild, but`1
it was kind of grand`1

it was late in the`1
it was light, and had`1
it was like being born`1
it was like spirits carrying`1

it was like; but he`1
it was loaded, then I`1
it was looking for the`1
it was luckier I didn't.`1
it was mighty pleasing to`1
it was mighty still in`1
it was minutes and minutes`1
it was more than a`1
it was mortification--that was it.`1
it was most abreast of`1
it was most daylight and`1
it was my old Jim!`1
it was my turn.  He`1
it was nearly three o'clock,`1
it was neither more nor`1

it was over the banks.`1
it was packed, and the`1
it was perfectly lovely the`1
it was perfectly round, she`1
it was piled up.  Well,`1
it was plenty good enough`1
it was powerful warm weather;`1
it was pretty bad money,`1
it was pretty broad day;`1
it was pretty good; but`1
it was pretty skreeky and`1
it was quite impossible to`1

it was sawed, you wouldn't`1

it was smart.  He said`1
it was sneezing and howling`1
it was so dark we`2
it was so dark; and`1
it was so dark; but`1
it was so lively, and`1
it was so quiet; but`1
it was so slick it`1
it was so still, and`1
it was so; and the`1
it was so; so they`1
it was solid white and`1
it was some more work`1
it was spirits; but I`1
it was stealing.  He said`1
it was such a lowering`1

it was tough work toting`1
it was very like having`1
it was very provoking to`1

it was warm, and the`1
it was watermelon."  "So`1
it was well a boat`1
it was well into the`1

it was wicked to say`1
it was with the niggers--it`1
it was woody and there`1
it was worse than chasing`1
it was worth fifteen of`1
it was worth it, too.`1
it was worth it; and`1
it was worth twice the`1
it was worth, and I`1
it was written to nobody,`1
it was you that said`1
it was!' said Alice, as`1
it was!--but I couldn't help`1
it was) scratching and scrambling`1
it was, "Yes, crush, cold`1
it was, and I see`1
it was, and so it`1
it was, and, as the`1
it was, even before she`1
it was, even for murderers,`1
it was, too--seemed a week`1
it was, underneath.  This`1
it was,' he said. `1
it was,' said the Mock`1
it was,' the March Hare`1
it was--I noticed it.  Well,`1
it was--a skiff, away across`1
it was--didn't seem to be`1

it was.  We had`1
it was.  And we had`1
it was.  I knowed he`1
it was: at first she`1
it was: she was beginning`1

it wasn't enough; but I`1
it wasn't for a dog."`1
it wasn't good of you`1
it wasn't trouble enough hatching`1
it wasn't very civil of`1
it wasn't where I thought`1
it wasn't your fault.  Where`1
it watched the Queen till`1
it we would keep it`1
it went off and shot`1
it went sliding off through`1
it went through me like`1
it went, 'One side will`1
it went, as if it`1
it went, but the towhead`1
it went.  So she`1
it were nine o'clock in`1

it what you like,' said`1
it when I heard pap's`1
it when a body like`1
it when he gets to`1

it when her pictures had`1

it when it's handed back,`1
it when she turned the`1

it will be done in`1
it with a long stick,`1
it with a pencil.  I`1
it with all of them.`1
it with guns, and they`1
it with my hands; but`1
it with nods, and signs`1
it with tears."  "She'll`1
it with the audience, but`1
it with the nail, and`1
it with the saw, for`1
it with your tears.  It's`1
it with your tears." `1
it without charge with others.`1
it without seeing it.  He`1
it woke up again with`1

it won't," I says. `1

it would be; I just`1
it would be; but I`1
it would blow over by`1

it would feel very queer`1
it would fetch bad luck;`1
it would fool _anybody_.  In`1

it wouldn't be much like`1

it wouldn't cost nothing.  Then`1
it wouldn't do at all.`1
it wouldn't do no good."`1
it wouldn't do to try`1

it's a blame ridicklous way,`1
it's a blame' good way,`1
it's a fool way, anyhow.`1
it's a good hiding-place for`1

it's a prime good idea.`1

it's all right."  So`1
it's all terrible sad; but`1
it's always done, and take`1

it's angry, and wags its`1

it's bad luck; but what`1
it's because you ain't one`1

it's best to tell your`1

it's called a whiting?' `1
it's called an evasion.  It's`1
it's case-knives."  "_Now_ you're`1
it's come at last! We`1
it's come true; en heah`1
it's coming down! Heads below!'`1
it's considered best to kill`1

it's cool.  If you notice,`1
it's daytime and you're not`1

it's diffunt.  _He_ as soon`1
it's dirty, low-down business; but`1
it's done by everybody minding`1

it's done right.  You got`1

it's done.  What I want`1
it's done.'  'Once upon`1

it's foolishness to handle a`1

it's his right; and so,`1
it's in a prison.  And`1
it's in the books?  Do`1
it's in the breed.  I`1
it's in the regulations, and`1
it's jis' as well we`1
it's just the little things`1
it's just what they _would_`1

it's kind of slow, and`1
it's like. Here's the law`1
it's likely pap's been back`1
it's likely to break up`1
it's long stairs and they`1
it's lucky; because sometimes people`1
it's marked "poison" or not';`1
it's mighty fidgety business to`1
it's mighty hard; I spec'`1
it's mixed up with other`1
it's most night, and Sid`1
it's mostly done that way.`1
it's my bounden duty to`1
it's my opinion, s'I, 'n'`1
it's no use going back`1
it's no use now,' thought`1
it's on account of the`1

it's pap, though I warn't`1

it's pleased so far,' thought`1
it's pleased. Now I growl`1
it's reckoned he left three`1

it's so kind of strange`1

it's so.  He was often`1

it's the _right_ way--and it's`1
it's the best way.  Ma`1
it's the best way; then`1
it's the common term, because`1
it's the custom in Europe;`1
it's the hand of a`1

it's the plan _now_." `1
it's the regular way.  And`1
it's the stupidest arrangement I`1

it's tolable dark in heah,`1
it's too bad, that it`1

it's too good for true.`1
it's too, too hard!" `1
it's troublesome to do right`1

it, and a painted border`1

it, and be perfectly satisfied.`1

it, and burning with curiosity,`1

it, and give it to`1
it, and he done the`1
it, and he eat it`1
it, and he got so`1
it, and he mustn't eat`1
it, and he was more`1
it, and hid it there,`1
it, and his shroud on.`1
it, and how it's the`1
it, and in two seconds`1
it, and it comes out`1
it, and it had a`1
it, and it knowed everything.`1
it, and it was kind`1
it, and it was pretty`1
it, and it was that`1
it, and kept doubling itself`1
it, and kill the lot`1
it, and left.  Miss`1
it, and licked their chops.`1
it, and maybe see a`1
it, and nobody don't blame`1
it, and on both sides`1
it, and pretty soon away`1
it, and remembered about the`1
it, and reward.  So every`1
it, and said he would`1
it, and says, "That secret`1
it, and says:  "I`1

it--which won't be long after`1

it.  'Well!' thought Alice`1
it.  All of a`1
it.  And in the`1
it.  And it didn't.`1
it.  And so for`1
it.  And then when`1
it.  As soon as`1
it.  He was uncommon`1
it.  In the morning`1
it.  It was a`1
it.  It was the`1
it.  Jim put the`1
it.  Jim sucked and`1
it.  Next day Tom`1
it.  Presently the Rabbit`1
it.  She stretched herself`1
it.  Some thought it`1
it.  The judge he`1
it.  The nearer it`1
it.  Then he says,`1
it.  Then he showed`1
it.  Twenty people sings`1
it.  Well, they held`1
it.  When Jim called`1
it.  When we got`1
it.  When we was`1
it. 'That's very curious!' she`1
it. 'They must go by`1
it. After a while she`1
it. And he said people`1
it. And yet I wish`1
it. But I couldn't set`1
it. But I never said`1
it. But the duke says:`1
it. But up till then`1
it. Come right in." `1
it. Her face would give`1
it. I clipped along, and`1
it. I know, because I've`1
it. I suppose you'll be`1
it. I was all over`1
it. In the South one`1
it. Is your husband going`1
it. It ain't regular." `1
it. Jim said he reckoned`1
it. Mighty soon we'll have`1
it. My hands shook, and`1
it. No light there; the`1
it. Once I got a`1
it. She felt that she`1
it. She put me in`1
it. She went in without`1
it. The duke went down`1
it. The king said the`1
it. The price of the`1
it. The skiff was half`1
it. Then one of them`1
it. There could be no`1
it. There was not a`1
it. There's a hand that`1
it. They've got a good`1
it. Thinks as long as`1
it. We'll let it alone`1
it. When I got up`1
it. Whenever I got uncommon`1
it. Why, half the time`1
it. You've been treated bad,`1
it.  "What made you think`1
it.  "Wher' you bound for,`1
it.  A body might stump`1
it.  A harem's a bo'd'n-house,`1
it.  All the nobility does."`1
it.  All through dinner Jim`1
it.  All we needed was`1
it.  And I wrote another`1
it.  And all the time`1
it.  And don't call it`1
it.  And it was the`1
it.  And next time Jim`1
it.  And she took snuff,`1
it.  And the next time`1
it.  And then mosey right`1
it.  And they train them,`1
it.  And we done it`1
it.  And what would you`1
it.  And yet, you know,`1
it.  Been there ever since;`1
it.  But I couldn't make`1
it.  But I dasn't go`1
it.  But I didn't.  As`1
it.  But I never said`1
it.  But at supper, at`1
it.  But it warn't so.`1
it.  But not feeling brash.`1
it.  But they'll get the`1
it.  Den I reck'n'd I'd`1
it.  Dey ain' no sense`1
it.  Directly it begun to`1
it.  Don't I tell you`1
it.  En what use is`1
it.  Every minute it was`1
it.  Every time one of`1
it.  Has everybody quit thinking`1
it.  He can say he`1
it.  He carried a mahogany`1
it.  He dressed Jim up`1
it.  He is the thinnest`1
it.  He said he'd be`1
it.  He said that in`1
it.  He said there was`1
it.  He told them he`1
it.  He told us to`1
it.  He turned blue all`1
it.  He's _got_ to have`1
it.  Here she was a-bothering`1
it.  Here's a dollar for`1
it.  Here, Mary Jane, Susan,`1
it.  His hair was long`1
it.  Honest _injun_, I will.`1
it.  How _you_ talk, you`1
it.  I _would_ just like`1
it.  I been there before.`1
it.  I could show her`1
it.  I couldn' manage to`1
it.  I crept up the`1
it.  I didn't know nothing`1
it.  I don't hear the`1
it.  I don't k'yer noth'n`1
it.  I don't want it`1
it.  I done it, and`1
it.  I fetched the pig`1
it.  I got an old`1
it.  I had my doubts`1
it.  I hain't ever hearn`1
it.  I judged she would`1
it.  I know perfectly well`1
it.  I needn't tell what`1
it.  I owns mysef, en`1
it.  I said I reckoned`1
it.  I said likely we`1
it.  I said no, but`1
it.  I says to myself,`1
it.  I says:  "Here's`1
it.  I sole de hide`1
it.  I studied a minute,`1
it.  I thought I was`1
it.  I want it." `1
it.  I was going to`2
it.  I was too small`1
it.  I watched it come`1
it.  I went and told`1
it.  I went out in`1
it.  I wished the widow`1
it.  I'll lay for you,`1
it.  I'll take the order`1
it.  I'll walk--I don't mind`1
it.  I'm at my wit's`1

it.  It give the dwelling-house`1
it.  It kept a-coming, and`1
it.  It swore every boy`1
it.  It took away all`1
it.  It warn't no towhead`1
it.  It warn't quite midnight`1
it.  It was as big`1
it.  It was beautiful to`1
it.  It was cool in`1
it.  It was only a`1
it.  It's a very good`1
it.  Jim hitched it behind`1
it.  Jim said he reckoned`1
it.  Jim said he'd had`1
it.  Jim told me to`1
it.  Jim was most ruined`1
it.  Jim won't ever forgit`1
it.  Keep the river road`1
it.  Let 'em fetch along`1
it.  Mars Buck he loaded`1
it.  My servant here k'n`1
it.  Niggers would come from`1
it.  Oh, he's sly, I`1
it.  One man said it`1
it.  One time Tom sent`1
it.  Other times it was`1
it.  Pa's luck didn't hold`1
it.  Pap told me.  But`1
it.  Picks and shovels--why, they`1
it.  Pretty soon I found`1
it.  Prisoners ain't ever without`1
it.  Right then along comes`1
it.  S'pose he contracted to`1
it.  Says I, if it`1
it.  Says I--"  I`1

it.  Specially, painful music; and`1
it.  Stick a candle in`1
it.  Take my trunk in`1
it.  That's a Frenchman's _way_`1
it.  That's the correct idea."`1
it.  The best way's to`1
it.  The girls said they`1
it.  The lawyer looked powerful`1
it.  The lot of towheads`1
it.  The old man said`1
it.  The reading was all`1
it.  The sky looks ever`1
it.  The thing for us`1
it.  The walls of all`1
it.  Then he says: `1
it.  Then he took a`1
it.  Then it was most`1
it.  Then the duke says:`1
it.  Then the old man`2
it.  Then we got allycumpain`1

it.  There warn't no frivolishness`1

it.  Well, it does beat`1
it.  Well, when the place`1

it.  When the court wants`1
it.  When the woman stopped`1
it.  Which end gets up`1
it.  Which was all right,`1
it.  Who's _they_?"  "Why,`1
it.  Will you?"  Mary`1

it."  "Good-bye, sir," says`1
it."  "Hold on a`1

knowed enough to keep still.`1
knowed enough to talk on`1

knowed everything.  So I went`1

light out of the Tooleries,`1
light out.  I never see`1
light over yonder-way, and turn`1
light showed up; and when`1
light showed was the varmint`1
light showed, and tell them`1

light, and had my breakfast,`1
light, and laid on my`1

light, and started up stairs`1
light, but as soon as`1

light.  We talked about Cairo,`1
lighted up, and it made`1
lighten like everything; so the`1
lighten; so the birds was`1
lighting out."  That made`1
lighting. Jim said it was`1
lightning a-ripping around and the`1
lightning beginning to wink and`1
lightning begun to flicker out`1
lightning bugs; so he set`1
lightning come brisker and brisker,`1
lightning glared out we could`1
lightning kept whimpering, and by`1
lightning let go a perfect`1

lightning, and sent a man`1
lightning, and the rain poured`1
lightning-rod a little after ten,`1
lightning-rod and come along. I'll`1

lights by and by--that was`1
lights of a town away`1
lights out of me.  But`1
lights twinkling, where there was`1

minute:  Three big men with`1

minute; and will let you`1
minute; this time I reckon`1

minutes ago, and I reckon`1
minutes and minutes that there`1
minutes before I could work`1

minutes, and so he _must_`1
minutes, and you could see`1
minutes, but set there studying`1
minutes, or maybe four, I`1
minutes, picking tallow-drip off of`1
minutes, to carry the nonnamous`1
minutes.  The Caterpillar was`1
minutes. Alice thought to herself,`1
minutes.  It had the big`1
minutes; but it seemed a`1
minutes; en when I come`1
minutes?"  "Well, hang it`1
mire under the iron heel`1
misable business; but, alas, the`1

miserable business to have any`1
miserable doings to go only`1

morals.  Ain't I right?" `1
more HERE.'  'But then,'`1
more I studied about this`1
more I'll get down there,`1
more _like_," he says.  "It's`1
more a-coming; and then you`1
more a-coming; you could see`1
more about him, because I`1
more about it, but after`1
more about it.  If he`1
more about me.  All right;`1
more about my family--I mean`1
more about reforming.  I shoved`1

one, of course.  So I`1
one, or heard of one,'`1
one, private, in Jim's coffee-pot,`1
one, s'I, let him _do_`1
one, sir."  "Well, there's`1
one, the cook took the`1
one, they gave him two,`1
one, though we hunted all`1

one, too; and we'll take`1
one, with his right arm`1

one--William ain't more than thirty`1

one."  "Was Peter Wilks`1

one; and run this way`1
one; and so he was`1

one; he had about a`1
one; how we set the`1
one; so, when the Rabbit`1

ones, and a few of`1
ones, he opened up passageways,`1
ones, he reckoned--and then they`1
ones, property, everything; but it`1
ones, too, a little bit.`1

so much to blame; but`1
so much trouble and run`1
so much trouble, he'd forgot`1

so much trouble; I couldn't`1

so much!' said Alice, as`1
so much, and so did`1
so much, too, and locking`1
so much.  I had`1
so much.  He had set`1
so much.  I reckoned I`1
so mysterious-like, I felt just`1

so slow; but I told`1
so small as this before,`1
so so much.  He had`1
so sometimes when I went`1
so sore.  At last he`1
so sorry that I thought`1
so sorry--and so glad and`1
so started home.  I`1
so steady and gentle, and`1
so steep and the bushes`1
so still and lonesome. `1
so still, and sounds come`1
so stingy about it, you`1
so stirred up," she says;`1
so strong in his head`1
so sudden and so pat,`1
so sudden; and, mind you,`1
so suddenly that Alice had`1
so suddenly: you make one`1
so swift, and then I`1
so swift.  In another`1

so thankful.  In another second`1

so well at the widow's,`1
so well off.  Bless you,`1
so well only last week!`1
so what was the use`1
so what's the use o'`1
so when I couldn't stand`1

so yet,' said Alice; 'but`1
so you ain't had no`1

so's to be all ready`1

so, and sound so honest`1
so, and swallow the sawdust,`1
so, and swap places so`1
so, and then we all`1

so, in a little while,`1
so, m'am."  It was`1
so, my boy--good-bye, good-bye.  If`1
so, so they say, but`1
so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer`1
so, take it all around,`1
so, that Alice could hardly`1

so, three times they come`1
so, very carefully, with one`1
so, when the Rabbit came`1

so,' Alice replied thoughtfully. 'They`1
so,' said Alice.  'Then`1
so,' said Alice.  'Well,`1
so,' said the Duchess: 'and`1
so,' said the Hatter: 'as`1
so--" and was going to`1
so--I couldn't get around that`1
so--R-o-o-meo! that is the idea;`1

so.  He said there was`1
so.  He said they was`1

so.  Then she told me`1
so.  They all crowded up`1
so.  You can do it.`1
so.  You've had to keep`1

somehow, for thinking.  And every`1
somehow--perfect saphead."  I thought`1
somehow--though I hadn't done nothing.`1
somehow. I judged that that`1
somehow. I was the only`1
somehow. They said you would,`1
somehow.  I was going to`1
somehow.  They kept Emmeline's room`1
somehow.  Yes, she said, say`1
somehow; I couldn't seem to`1
somehow; and I got to`1
somehow; and the minute I`1
someone to listen to her.`1
somersault in the sea!' cried`1
something _like_.  That'll answer.  Why`1
something about General Washington and`1
something about nobody ever heard`1
something about the games now.'`1
something about these two, let`1
something after death Murders the`1
something again.  He raised up,`1
something ain't straight about it."`1
something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo. I`1
something at last; I found`1
something behind her every time--so`1
something being a raftsman on`1
something better with the time,'`1
something better--I'll give you a`1
something brisk, and said let`1
something cheerful, but it warn't`1
something comes at me like`1
something else.  So I went`1
something for her and not`1
something for her, but I`1
something fresh all the time.`1
something fresh, anyway.  Le's commence`1
something gone wrong?"  The`1
something had been dragged over`1
something he'd started in on--`1
something if all of you`1
something important to say!' `1
something in it when a`1
something in that thing--that is,`1
something in that.  We are`1
something inside of me kept`1
something into the boat, and`1
something is up.  Sometimes it's`1
something laying on the floor`1
something like chalk, and painted`1
something like it,' said Alice.`1
something like that that's always`1
something like that they can`1
something like that. Then they`1
something like that.  So we`1
something like this:--  `1
something more.  'You promised`1
something more; the longer she`1
something muffled up under his`1
something now. Tell her to`1
something of the sort. `1
something on a paper and`1
something on him.  I waited,`1
something on his mind.  So,`1
something on the Arkansaw village;`1
something or other, which showed`1
something or other; but the`1
something out of a bottle.`1
something over it, and then`1
something ruther worse than low`1
something splashing about in the`1
something struck me.  I says,`1
something that's on its mind`1
something the matter?"  "Please`1
something they give me for`1
something to answer encores with,`1
something to eat as quick`1
something to eat before I`1
something to eat for us,`1
something to eat, and give`1
something to it; but he`1
something to know how much`1
something to make a saw`1
something to me, and I`1
something up there that 'll`1
something was up.  And then`1
something wasn't done about it`1
something with my hands; so`1
something worth having out of`1
something worth hearing. For some`1
something you could touch her`1
something you no business to,`1
something you won't want." `1
something!'  'I--I'm a little`1
something's up; it ain't natural`1
something's up?  Let them find`1
something, and says:  "You`1
something, and then a lawsuit`1
something, and turns and says:`1
something, but they said, 'What,`1
something, my dear, and that`1
something, s'posing you was up;`1
something.  After midnight the`1
something. And so did I.`1
something. So then we was`1
something. We fixed up a`1
something. Well, there's others can`1
something.  I knowed mighty well`1
something.  If you get here`1
something.  Is there anybody here`1
something.  No, you go right`1
something.  So did Jim.  I`1
something.  We got to be`1
something.  We was out of`1
something."  "No'm, I ain't`1
something; I got to set`1
something; I knowed very well`1
something; and she heard it`1
something; and then they give`1
sometimes I lifted a chicken`1
sometimes I'm the freight and`1
sometimes Lifted a Chicken `1
sometimes a strip of land`1
sometimes another.  But there's always`1
sometimes choked with sobs, to`1
sometimes he'll listen to her.`1
sometimes it wouldn't talk without`1
sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and`1
sometimes not that way, because`1
sometimes on the water you`1
sometimes people do get hurt.`1
sometimes she scolded herself so`1
sometimes shorter, until she had`1
sometimes storms, and we a-floating`1
sometimes taller and sometimes shorter,`1
sometimes the bullfrogs a-cluttering, maybe.`1
sometimes the one that owns`1
sometimes the table was set`1
sometimes the vines hung so`1
sometimes the wheel bites off`1
sometimes they wash them over`1
sometimes when I went up`1
sometimes when one of these`1
sometimes you could hear a`1
sometimes you gwyne to git`1
sometimes, 'Do bats eat cats?'`1
sometimes, and so that was`1
sometimes, but I hadn't any`1
sometimes, but we let them`1
sometimes, when he wrote home;`1
sometimes--oh, I do lots of`1
sometimes.  But this one was`1
sometimes.  She says:  "Did`1
sometimes; and so, three times`1
sometimes?"  They says: `1
somewhere for me. The world`1
somewhere near the centre of`1
somewhere.'  Down, down, down.`1
somewheres I hears a small`1
somewheres and says he'll help,`1
somewheres at half-past two and`1
somewheres suffering or dead, and`1
somewheres where he had laid`1
somewheres, and fetched up on`1
somewheres, and you take them`1
somewheres, because if they missed`1
somewheres. But not long, because`1
somewheres.  So we judged we`1
somewheres; all I wanted was`1
son away from him--a man's`1
son o' Louis somebody, 'n'`1

son of New England merchant.`1

that no one owns a`1

that nothing more happened, she`1
that notion for two things:`1
that notion; but he said`1
that noway.  That was where`1
that ocean; and though it`1
that off--I never see such`1
that old Judge Thatcher up`1
that old blister for clean`1
that old cabin, and he`1
that old calico.  You do`1
that old doctor for doing`1
that old doctor; and Jim,`1
that old idiot cut. `1

that one."  I wanted`1
that other fellow.  But you're`1
that other man's brother kills`1
that other time.  They had`1
that ought to settle it,`1
that ourn is lambs, because`1
that out of my conscience,`1
that out.  So I`1
that owns the tobacco looks`1
that palace around over the`1

that part of the work,`1
that part.'  'Well, at`1
that particular.  Full of principle.`1
that pass I didn't have`1
that people that acts as`1
that performance!  I don't deny`1
that perhaps it was only`1
that person and his family`1
that person, I'll come up:`1
that pets them.  Any book`1

that pie.  We fixed it`1

that thing--that is, there's something`1
that thing.  The king allowed`1
that this bread would find`1
that this could not be`1

that three nights more would`1
that three nights.  I never`1

that time, so Jim he`1
that time, so of course`1
that time?"  "That's more`1
that time?"  "Yes--indeedy." `1
that to be done, I`1
that to fool folks, and`1
that to--"  "It don't`1
that told the secrets.  Tom`1
that tooth without fetching the`1
that touched me while I`1
that town Cairo?"  "Cairo?`1
that town a heap worse`1
that town again I'd be`1
that town and everybody in`1
that town but how splendid`1
that town that I didn't`1
that town that's got as`1
that town yonder in daylight--it`1
that town, too--steps out of`1

that trick took 'em to`1
that trouble and bother to`1

that uneasy 't I crep'`1
that up till he had`1
that ups and tells the`1
that used to be hers`1
that used to come once`1
that used to rip around`1
that very few little girls`1
that very few things indeed`1
that very handy, not being`1
that very time!  I tell`1
that very well.  Then I`1
that walk with their heads`1
that walks this earth!" `1
that wanted her to ever`1
that wants to join has`1
that wants to protect you`1
that wants to, and goes`1
that warn't buried was more`1
that warn't going to keep`1
that warn't no good because`1
that warn't nothing to some`1
that warn't pap's style.  Nine`1
that warn't romantical enough for`1
that warn't roosting comfortable, and`1
that warn't too young or`1
that warn't yard-stick straight; so`1
that was Jim and not`1
that was Uncle Silas, when`1
that was _him_.  In another`1
that was a better nuss`1
that was a lie:  he`1
that was a rest to`1
that was a satisfaction to`1
that was all easy, so`1
that was all right, because`1
that was all.  He had`1
that was already free before?`1
that was always nuts for`1
that was an awful bad`1
that was any account.  The`1
that was as big as`1
that was as good as`1
that was as long going`1
that was at the show`1
that was behind the wood-rank`1
that was being fed.  The`1
that was bricked on the`1
that was calculated to make`1
that was comfortable for me;`1
that was dead, and a`1
that was down the river`1
that was down was sympathy,`1
that was enough.  It made`1
that was enough; there wouldn't`1
that was first-rate, and she`1
that was five mile wide`1
that was going on around`1
that was going to die;`1
that was gone up to`1
that was high-toned had it.`1
that was how I come`1
that was human--just looked like`1
that was in Jim's pan,`1
that was in front of`1
that was laying just ahead`1
that was linked into hers`1
that was lying under the`1
that was making over four`1
that was making the trouble`1
that was more nearer her`1
that was my money.  Where`1
that was on a pine`1
that was on the bank.`1
that was out of reach,`1
that was out of the`1
that was planted and comfortable.`1
that was respectable and well`1
that was said, and went`1
that was sitting on the`1
that was so nice and`1
that was sort of piling`1
that was still smoking. `1
that was stole?  Why can't`1
that was suitable.  He warn't`1
that was that Tom Sawyer`1
that was the boot that`1
that was the hand of`1
that was the one I`1
that was too many for`1
that was trickling down his`1
that was under the feather-bed,`1
that was ungrateful enough to`1
that was valuable, not on`1
that was very dear to`1
that was watching the corpse`1
that was what made me`1
that was what pap always`1
that was what we lived`1
that was what we was`1
that was what you'd been`1
that was why I struck`1
that was worth a cent.`1
that wasn't chained I snatched`1
that watermelon or that Sunday-school`1
that way after I had`1
that way by yourself in`1
that way every night grieving.`1
that way for some reason`1
that way for, and laid`1
that way in the air.`1
that way it could be`1
that way myself, though I've`1
that way nights, when he`1
that way on a piece`1
that way to an old`1
that way without anybody to`1
that way, Jim was.  I`1
that way, and begun to`1
that way, and it keeps`1
that way, and so he`1
that way, and then he`1
that way, because they've left`1
that way, it was awful.`1
that way, like a bull--you`1
that way, like a fool.`1
that way, so I says:`1
that way, there was rope`1
that way--said any fool would`1
that way.   `1
that way.  It was`1
that way. Tom, I want`1
that way.  And I've et`1
that way.  I see I'd`1
that way.  It injured the`1
that way.  You can't be`1
that way; and you see`1
that way; how long was`1
that way; it wouldn't do`1
that we canoed up to`1
that we could see them`1
that we didn't feel so`1
that we don't know nothing`1
that we had that talk.`1
that we keep them till`1
that we know not of.`1
that we laughed--only a little`1
that we was all right`1
that we was at it`1
that we was free and`1
that we wouldn't have nothing`1
that we've struck here--plenty grub`1
that well enough.  I started`1
that went a-slipping along, black`1
that went by was beating`1
that went in had his`1
that went miles away, I`1
that were of the same`1
that what a man wanted`1
that what he meant was,`1
that what you live on?"`1
that what you saw?" `1
that what you were or`1
that when Aunt Sally wrote`1
that when I went in`1
that when Mrs. Phelps took`1
that when he's drunk.  He's`1
that when you've lost a`1
that whenever he got _his_`1
that wherever you go to`1
that wherever you leave a`1
that whole river all to`1
that will be the best`1
that will make _them_ feel`1
that will pay, Bilgewater; but,`1
that will show that I`1
that window-hole before this, only`1
that with her disposition she`1
that with sixteen men and`1
that without any notice, because`1
that without it many readers`1
that woman; and Jim said`1
that won the suit--which he`1
that wonderful spread of lights`1
that work down and light`1
that work, Sister Phelps.  Look`1
that would a been a`1
that would be bound to`1
that would be four thousand`1
that would bend the trees`1
that would bring bad luck.`1
that would come to us`1
that would do him more`1
that would do.  And that`1
that would get us away`1
that would happen: '"Miss Alice!`1
that would help.  Then I`1
that would make you wilt`1
that would show.  But I`1
that would tell on it`1
that would try to do`1
that would wash. But he`1
that wreck if it was`1
that wreck laying there so`1
that wrote it, I 'low`1
that yaller girl's frock." `1
that yard like a sheep;`1
that yesterday.  He oughter know`1
that yonder?"  "A piece`1
that you _did_ hide that`1
that you all goes to`1

that you can do with`1
that you come near spiling`1

that you never tasted an`1

that you think you can`1

that you wake up.  Well,`1
that you weren't to talk`1
that you will support the`1
that you would think the`1
that you wouldn't hear nothing`1

that you're mad?'  'To`1
that you've found, instead of`1
that young fellow.  Blamed if`1
that young flathead that we`1
that young fool going up`1

that!  But it warn't no`1

that!'  'Call the first`1
that!'  'I couldn't help`1
that!'  By this time`1
that!' But she did not`1

that!' screamed the Queen. 'You`1
that'd like to know who`1
that'll do; you can't be`1
that'll fix it. We'll let`1
that's a Lie"  "Here`1
that's a considerble sight better`1
that's a fact.'  Alice`1
that's a good boy.  It`1
that's a good boy." `1
that's a lie.  What _is_`1
that's a little more complicated`1
that's about the right distance--but`1
that's all I can say.'`1
that's all I said.  It`1
that's all interpreted well enough`1
that's all right, because a`1
that's all right.  Le's go`1
that's all the first figure,'`1
that's all very fine to`1
that's all you know about`1
that's all, though that's worth`1
that's all--so dry up your`1
that's all.  I says to`1
that's all.  I think it's`1
that's all.  It ain't anything.`1
that's always getting into bread,`1
that's always on the lookout,`1
that's always the most anxious`1
that's always the way; it`1
that's because it stays the`1
that's been dead ever so`1
that's been done. Look at`1
that's been drownded nine days.`1
that's been making all this`1
that's ben snaked down wrongfully`1
that's born in them, but`1
that's borrowed from their mass,`1
that's called fox-fire, and just`1
that's dry."  Buck looked`1
that's easy fixed."  "Tools?"`1
that's enough for _them_; they're`1
that's enough!" and she snatched`1
that's enough--put your head in."`1
that's entitled to it most.`1
that's every bit and grain`1
that's foolishness. Why can't a`1
that's going to happen is,`1
that's going to happen; the`1
that's gone, nuther.  Ther's a`1
that's googling out buttermilk; and`1
that's got a dry throat,`1
that's got as fine clothes`1
that's got left is the`1
that's got sand in it.`1
that's got the mumps." `1
that's got to make signs,`1
that's had a secret of`1
that's had a tooth pulled`1
that's had troubles like that."`1
that's here on the island`1
that's honest.  I won't say`1
that's infernal mean.  Odd, too.`1
that's it,' said the Hatter`1
that's jist as good and`1
that's just what I was`1
that's laid in a cupboard`1
that's left behind in the`1
that's left fatherless and motherless.`1
that's left now; and, as`1
that's made up out'n the`1
that's mighty curious.  _Who_ sung`1
that's mighty curious; he said`1
that's my opinion, take it`1
that's not a regular rule:`1
that's on its mind and`1
that's one mistake, and the`1
that's out of kings." `1
that's regular; you want to`1
that's so.  You've had to`1
that's something _like_.  That'll answer.`1
that's started in on a`1
that's sweetened and sanctified to`1
that's the common sort and`1
that's the dead; tramp--tramp--tramp; they're`1
that's the jury, of course--"I`1
that's the jury-box,' thought Alice,`1
that's the long and the`1
that's the queerest thing about`1
that's the reason.  You make`1
that's the thing I'm a-going`1
that's the thing for _you_`1
that's the way I'd like."`1
that's the way I'm agreed,`1
that's the way a woman`1
that's the way of it.`1
that's the way of it?"`1
that's there, and maybe you'd`1
that's twice as long.  There`1
that's very like a mouse,`1
that's what I mean." `1
that's what I think about`1
that's what I'm a-saying; all`1
that's what an army is--a`1
that's what they do.  I've`1
that's what we've got to`1
that's what you are!" `1
that's why. Pig!'  She`1
that's worn and soiled and`1
that's worth as much in`1
that's worth something. Well, there's`1
that, Huckleberry--set up straight;" and`1
that, Huckleberry--why don't you try`1
that, I says to myself.`1
that, I'm so glad to`1
that, all through his speech,`1
that, and I see I`1
that, and I would a`1
that, and done the same`1
that, and it's a blame'`1
that, and make him a`1
that, and won't bother no`1
that, as nearly as she`1
that, because I had tried`1
that, because I wanted him`1
that, but hung up his`1
that, but it was all`1
that, can't he?"  "I`1
that, every time he told`1
that, for pretty soon all`1
that, for two or three`1
that, if he'll sell it`1
that, if you drink much`1
that, if you like,' said`1
that, in her haste, she`1
that, it was a good`1
that, it was such a`1
that, maybe you'll let me`1
that, not if I _never_`1
that, now!  I might have`1
that, now!  What's the matter`1
that, now!  You bet _I'd_`1
that, now.  You do beat`1
that, shouting, "It's the brazen`1
that, so I put the`1
that, so I says to`1
that, so he didn't try.`1
that, though I couldn't see`1
that, too.  And there was`1
that, too."  "But looky`1
that, too; because as long`1
that, we can _let on_,`1
that, when I stole a`1
that, you bet you." And`1
that, you know, and so`1
that, you know,' Alice gently`1
that," I says.  "Letting on`1
that," Tom says, "but you`1
that," he says; "we got`1
that,' continued the Hatter, 'I`1
that,' he said to the`1
that,' said Alice.  'Oh,`1
that,' said the Cat, 'if`1
that,' said the Cat: 'we're`1
that,' said the King, 'unless`1
that,' said the Mock Turtle.`1
that,' she added aloud. `1
that,' the Hatter went on`1
that--"  "Why, you must`1
that--and here we've gone and`1
that--but his brother would a`1
that--it's the _count_ I'm thinkin'`1
that--natcherl son o' Louis somebody,`1
that--only the March Hare said--'`1

that-air ladder made out'n rags,`1
that-air rag ladder, sh-she; 'n'`1
that-air sasser o' m'lasses, won't`1
that.  I took the`1
that.  Next day he`1
that.  These rapscallions wanted`1
that.  We went drifting`1
that.  Well, last I`1
that. Besides, you know, you'll`1
that. He told him everything.`1
that. Some day I'll lie`1
that. Then they tucked the`1
that.  And what's more--if I`1
that.  But by and by`1
that.  But it warn't no`1
that.  But that was enough.`1
that.  Fact is, I reckon`1
that.  Go 'long with you`1
that.  How is servants treated`1
that.  I fetched out the`1

the same steamboat landing, which`1

the same thing as "I`3
the same thing with you,'`1
the same thing, you know.'`1
the same thing,' said the`1
the same thing. But the`1
the same time don't bring`1
the same time, and in`1
the same time, to show`1
the same time.  The second`1
the same time."  "Well,`1
the same tone, exactly as`1
the same way I do`1
the same way the little`1
the same way to me,`1
the same way when young`1

the same, and the whole`1
the same, if he's missed`1
the same, shedding gallons of`1
the same, the next question`1
the same, to wit, as`1
the same--she was just that`1
the same.   `1
the same.  But as`1
the same.  I did`1
the same.  It was pretty`1
the same.  Jim got down`1
the same.  We struck the`1
the same.  You couldn't a`1

the same; and the place`1
the same; she couldn't face`1
the same?  I was stuck.`1
the sand with wooden spades,`1
the sands are all dry,`1
the sandy bottom where the`1
the saw on it, too."`1
the saw, for there warn't`1
the saw; and Jim allowed`1
the sawdust, and it give`1
the sawdust, so it can't`1
the sawdust.  Then I fixed`1
the sawed place so the`1
the sawmill.  I went`1
the saws, and pens, and`1
the saying is, and that's`1
the saying is? spos'n it`1
the scenes, they roared and`1
the scent."  They done`1
the school, but by and`1
the schoolroom, and though this`1
the scraping of the feet`1
the scratches he makes ain't`1
the scutcheon we'll have a`1
the sea _baths_--that's what I`1
the sea baths if it`1
the sea baths."  "Why,`1
the sea to get a`1
the sea!' cried the Mock`1
the sea, 'and in that`1
the sea, some children digging`1
the sea, though you mayn't`1
the sea,' the Gryphon went`1

the sea-shore--'  'Two lines!'`1
the sea. But they HAVE`1

the sea. They haven't got`1

the sea.'  'I couldn't`1

the seaside once in her`1
the season.  There was a`1
the seat at church between`1

the second one, and he`1
the second thing is to`1
the second time round, she`1
the second verse of the`1
the secret, and then showed`1
the secrets, he must have`1

the secrets.  Tom said it`1
the secrets; and if anybody`1
the seneskal with, it would`1

the sentence set forth in`1

the servant-girl?"  "You'll be`1

the sheds.  The women had`1

the sheep-signal; and here was`1

the short ones, he reckoned--and`1
the shot-tower, and spread himself`1
the shoulder and says: `1
the shoulder of the island.`1
the shoulder, like there was`1
the shouting and clattering; and`1
the shouting and crying.  Folks`1
the shovelfuls of dirt sailing`1

the smoke-house; one little hut`1
the smoke.  So I set`1
the smoke; because, you see,`1

the spoon, and says: `1
the spoon, and--"  "Oh,`1
the spoon, anyway, without knowing`1
the spoon-basket till we see`1

the stairs, saying:  "Well,`1
the stairs. Alice knew it`1

the steamboat landing; but they`1
the steamboat, Huckleberry; we'll come`1
the steamboat, clear through to`1
the steamboat.  Then Mary`1

the steamboat; going to Orleans."`1
the steamboats lands I worked`1

there was a dispute going`1
there was a dog fight.`1
there was a fine time.`1
there was a hole.  We`1
there was a large pool`1
there was a light behind`1

there was a thick fog,`1
there was a village on`1
there was an alarm; and`1
there was an awful scream`1

there was any hole there,`1
there was anything in it.`1
there was beautiful curtains on`1

there was ways to put`1

there watching, and by and`1
there we couldn't make nobody`1
there we had it, up`1
there we stopped.  Tom says:`1
there were TWO little shrieks,`1
there were a Duck and`1
there were any tears. `1
there were no arches left,`1
there were no tears. 'If`1
there were ten of them,`1
there were three gardeners at`1

there when we went back--we`1

there, and about a quarter`1
there, and all about the`1

there, and elephants and treasure,`1
there, and everybody bending a`1
there, and had a good`1
there, and he was up`1
there, and held his toes;`1
there, and if they didn't`1
there, and it always looks`1
there, and lay low till`1
there, and maybe you'd help`1
there, and opened the door`1
there, and pretty soon he`1
there, and raise it.  And`1
there, and she said not`1
there, and the door ain't`1
there, and then turned in.`1
there, and there ain't nothing`1

there, anyway; and he said`1
there, anyways.  So, now, le's`1
there, at any rate: go`1
there, away in the night.`1
there, because Jim's counter-pin hung`1
there, because we heard the`1
there, but I dasn't try`1
there, but she failed on`1

there, don't!  Yes, I'll go`1
there, everybody dropping back to`1
there, for I ain't got`1
there, for it was bent`1
there, horseback, from ten or`1
there, intending to give me`1
there, just inside the door,`1
there, knowing the mother and`1
there, looking down.  The stillness`1
there, not mine."  "_Well_!"`1
there, not noticing, meaning to`1
there, over the coffin, and`1
there, s'I.  Without _help_, mind`1
there, say it, and I'll`1
there, so cool and fresh`1
there, so they wouldn't be`1
there, somebody.  What did you`1
there, squirming and scrouging and`1
there, sure enough, and could`1
there, take it all around.`1
there, that would show.  But`1
there, the truest friend a`1

there. Then get up my`1

there.  I see him there.`1
there.  I shot past the`1

there.  Just then I heard`1
there.  Old Miss Watson died`1
there.  So I says: `1

there.  The old lady took`1

 It was an awful sight`1
 It was as big a`1

 It was most pesky tedious`1
 It was my watch below`1
 It was one of these`1
 It was only a little`1
 It was outrageous, and I`1
 It was pretty good times`1
 It was pretty ornery preaching--all`1
 It was right down awkward,`1
 It was so long ago."`1
 It was that dull kind`1
 It was the first I`1
 It was the king and`1
 It was the most astonishing`1
 It was the most undigestible`1
 It was the raft. `1
 It was the splendidest sight`1

 It's just like the way`1
 It's like picking up money`1
